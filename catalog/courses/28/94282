<div><h3>WGS 200 - Topics in Feminist Theory </h3>  <p><hr>Topics in Feminist Theory is designed to offer a survey of feminist theories and practices, and explores the relationship between gender, sexuality, race/ethnicity, and class.,. Focus changes with each offering, depending on faculty interest. <em>May be repeated for credit (taken a max of 2 times).</em></p>

<p><strong>Spring 2021 Topic: GENDER AND POWER. </strong>How does gender inequality arise, both within formal and informal institutions? What mechanisms and dynamics perpetuate such inequality? What strategies exist, both historically and in the contemporary moment, to challenge these inequalities?  This course examines the relationship between gender and power both theoretically and empirically. We will examine the historical existence of gender-based inequalities and explore the ways these animate the different waves of the feminist movement in the US context. We will also explore gender-based inequality in a global perspective, drawing on theoretical frameworks developed outside of the US to further our study of the relationship between gender and power. The course will conclude with various contemporary case studies, where students will use the theoretical frameworks developed throughout the course to analyze the relationship between gender and power as it emerges on today&#8217;s political stage.<br><br><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> <a href="preview_course_nopop.php?catoid=28&coid=94279" onclick="acalogPopup('preview_course.php?catoid=28&coid=94279&print', '3', 770, 530, 'yes');return false;" rel="remote /ajax/preview_course.php?catoid=28&coid=94279&display_options[location]=tooltip&show" id="tt4583" target="_blank">WGS 110 - Introduction to Women&#8217;s and Gender Studies</a><span style="display: none !important">&#160;</span> <br><br><strong>Course Designation/Attribute:</strong> GP<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> Spring<br><br></p><div style="display: none; z-index: 1000;" class="tooltip for_tt4583"></div></div>		</td>
