<div><h3>MPA 3030 - United States Health Care Policy </h3>  <hr>The accessibility, cost and delivery of healthcare is a daily challenge, and a broad topic for discussion in America. The issues are debated on the campaign trail, in Congress and in corporate board rooms. The main challenge in front of our nation is to deliver effective healthcare services at an affordable cost while maintaining the quality of care. In this course the student will develop an understanding of the many different insurers and government agencies that are responsible for providing access to and actual delivery of healthcare services. The course will focus on current critical issues in healthcare: the Medication Modernization Act (Medicare Part D), Medicaid, Universal Healthcare, the high cost of drugs, the Massachusetts Healthcare Connector, the growing number of uninsured in America, and healthcare reform. Additionally, the course will explore the significant impact of the baby boomer generation on the healthcare industry, increased life expectancies, and future technology initiatives (e-prescribing and electronic medical records).<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> varies<br><br></div>		</td>
