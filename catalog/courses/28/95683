<div><h3>SOC 220 - Special Topics in Sociology </h3>  <p><hr>This course addresses current or timely topics, that are in a pilot phase or that are known to be one time offerings.Â  Special Topics can vary from semester to semester.</p>

<p>FALL 2020 TOPIC:MYTH BUSTING POVERTY; RACE, GENDER, AND THE REALITIES OF BEING POOR IN THE U.S.This course unpacks our societal narratives about the realities of poverty and its causes through an intersectional lens, meaning that we will consider the simultaneous impact of race, gender, sexuality (and other categories of experience) on economic insecurity. We untangle the myths about poverty from its realities, and interrogate how assumptions and stereotypes related to gender, race, and sexuality inform these myths. We will also learn how these falsehoods are used to sustain and perpetuate economic inequality in the United States. Topics in the course include the wealth gap; the history of welfare; depictions of poverty in pop culture; and bringing attention to populations that often get left out of mainstream conversations about poverty.</p>
