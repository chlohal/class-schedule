<div><h3>ID 214 - Education and Youth in a Global Context </h3>  <hr>The human population is younger today than ever before. At the same time, education is seen as the most influential source of socialization for youth to become citizens, workers and change agents. This course, &#8220;Education and Youth in a Global Context,&#8221; is a graduate and upper level undergraduate (juniors and seniors) seminar that explores the natural synergies of youth and education from a global perspective. We will analyze the intersection of education and youth in thematic areas such as: self-discovery, identity and belonging; jobs and livelihood; vulnerability of youth; and the ways in which youth are viewed with suspicion and hope. We will also examine youth and education/schooling in the context of areas such as gender and sexuality, equity and equality, and justice in its various forms. The course aims to integrate practical field-based experience with classroom-based learning. Such practical experiences may take place through opportunities in Worcester and/or internationally (possibly Jamaica, Haiti or South Africa).<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> Bi-annually<br><br></div>		</td>
