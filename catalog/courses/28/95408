<div><h3>HS 100 - Symposium Seminar </h3>  <p><hr><span style="font-family:'times new roman', serif;font-size:11pt;">Students will explore the Higgins School&#8217;s symposium theme in-depth through event attendance, readings and screenings, in-class discussions, and short written assignments. While the symposium program is interdisciplinary by nature, the section instructor will draw particularly from their areas of specialization. This half-unit course may be added to a standard four-course load without fifth course approval, is offered on a &#8220;pass/fail&#8221; grading basis, and may be repeatable for credit. As with other Higgins School courses, this class is designed to help students to strengthen and enhance their college experience and to forge connections across and beyond conventional coursework.</span></p>

<p><strong><span style="font-family:'times new roman', serif;font-size:11pt;">SPRING 2022 TOPIC - FAIR GAME(S): SOCIAL CHANGE &amp; JUSTICE ON THE DIGITAL PLAYGROUND</span></strong></p>

<p><span style="font-family:'times new roman', serif;font-size:11pt;">Video games are now a dominant medium. Whether for entertainment and relaxation or education and research, gaming is increasingly integral to our individual lives and communities. Gaming serves as a forum for staging, processing, and testing experience, and as such, it is entangled with mainstream cultures of systematic exploitation and oppression. Many video games - and the industry that creates them - too frequently perpetuate injustice and mirror the inequities and violence that permeate society as a whole. But, they do more than merely represent or simulate reality. Many games already serve as an experimental form to help us reconsider and create resistance to problematic spaces and practices, and in doing so, alter the conditions of our everyday lives. To better understand these potentials, the Higgins seminar in Spring 2022 will explore the culture of games and gaming and the power and potential of video games to foster engagement and become a catalyst for social change and justice through user, practitioner, academic &amp; industry perspectives.</span><br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> Most semesters<br><br></p></div>		</td>
