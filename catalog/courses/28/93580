<div><h3>IDCE 361 - Project Management for Social Change </h3>  <p><hr>International development organizations organize their work through projects. Over the past four decades a wide range of tools, strategies and approaches have been developed to identify community needs, analyze stakeholder expectations, anticipate risks and implement a proposed set of activities - all in a context of significant resource constraints and uncertainty.  The course will begin with an overview of the project cycle,  focusing on the processes involved in project planning, with a special emphasis on engaging communities and stakeholders, and identifying, scheduling and sequencing project activities. The second part of the course focuses on project resource management, more specifically, learning approaches to establish internal controls, organize budgets, manage teams and communicate project results.  This course is for individuals who are interested/intend to work in the field of international development in program and project management.  The course utilizes case studies, action learning, and group participation to explore key themes. Students are expected to take an active part in the course through lab-based team assignments, presentations, working groups, and role-playing sessions. </p>
