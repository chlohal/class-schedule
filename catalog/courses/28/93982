<div><h3>PSCI 256 - Russian Politics: From Dictatorship to Democracy and Back Again </h3>  <hr>In this introduction to the study of Russian politics, we will explore how a single political party has come to dominate the national stage, while opposition politicians are jailed, human rights are violated, and journalists fall victim to assassins&#8217; bullets. In many ways, Russia appears to be turning back into a dictatorship only 15 years after throwing off seven decades of repressive communist party rule. Why and how has this happened? Through lectures, discussions, and films, we will examine contemporary Russia&#8217;s politics, economics, and culture. The course will touch on Russia&#8217;s history from 1917 to 1991, but our main focus will be on the contemporary period.
