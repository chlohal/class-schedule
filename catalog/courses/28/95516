<div><h3>MPA 3113 - Health and Public Safety Implications of Cannabis Use </h3>  <hr>This course seeks to address how the Public Safety and Health communities deal with cannabis as a controlled substance.  Students will explore how health providers and enforcement agencies can collaborate to minimize the potential negative effects of cannabis use within the community.  Much in the same way that alcohol abuse is viewed from both a public health and a public safety framework, this course encourages students to strategically and proactively develop solutions to mitigate the negative societal impact of the recreational use of cannabis.<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> Varied<br><br></div>		</td>
