<div><h3>EDUC 386 - Ways of Knowing in the Physical and Natural Sciences (Elementary, Middle/Secondary) </h3>  <hr>Basing our approach on the way scientists themselves learn about nature, this course explores science learning through experiment and theory. Our students are often simultaneously cast as both learner and teacher, in which roles they investigate a variety of science curricula and experience different classroom learning environments. Through discussions, readings and hands-on science lessons, they confront science content, science pedagogy, and the real-world constraints of state curriculum frameworks, professional standards and high-stakes testing. Observations in Worcester Public School classrooms provide a rich resource for testing the ideas against the everyday realities.<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> Offered every year<br><br></div>		</td>
