<div><h3>IDCE 30334 - Special Topics </h3>  <p><hr>This course addresses current or timely topics, that are in a pilot phase or that are known to be one time offerings.  Special Topics are unique for each instroctor and vary from semester to semester. May be repeatable for credit.</p>

<p><strong>SPRING 2022 TOPIC COMMUNITY POWER, COMMUNITY CHANGE - </strong>This course examines how communities build power for change. With an equity lens, the course will introduce students to the processes of structural change that improve community well-being and build community leadership. We will focus on community-driven solutions that change public policy and practice to address disparities in income, health, housing, education, and food access. Students will learn how different &#8220;bottom-up&#8221; strategies such as civic engagement, policy advocacy, community organizing, participatory action research, and public-private coalitions facilitate these changes and what diverse impacts they have on individual and institutional change. While this course draws primarily from a U.S. context, it covers theories, concepts, and practices that apply to local and global communities.</p>

<p><strong>Fall 2021 TOPICS&amp;nbsp; SECTION 01- TITLE: MODELING CLIMATE CHANGE &amp; WATER RESOURCES fOR SUSTAINABILITY</strong></p>

<p>(One Unit)</p>

<p>Climate change poses an enormous challenge to our management of water resources and related sectors and issues.  At the same time, factors such as population growth, land use and land cover change, construction of new infrastructure, and changing social habits also influence water resources and must be considered in the design of sustainable systems.  Water resources influence all major development sectors: human health and wellbeing; livelihoods and economy; energy systems; food systems and agriculture.  They are also critical to conserving ecosystems and biodiversity.  This interdependence of multiple sectors on water makes it a &#8216;gateway&#8217; into climate-change resilience and sustainability. </p>

<p>Cities, towns and their surrounding regions are experiencing the impacts of climate-change, climate variability and instability in ways that reflect the interdependence of issues and sectors: changes in rainfall and/or temperature can have cascading impacts.  To adequately understand and anticipate these impacts in a given place requires us to build models using social, economic and ecological data (qualitative, quantitative, geospatial and narrative).  This process needs to be participatory and collaborative, involving diverse stakeholders who co-create the model(s), derive understanding from them, and apply them to consider ways to respond to impacts and problems.</p>

<p>In this graduate seminar course, we will look at climate change impacts on water resource management in mega cities and their surrounding regions, using Mexico City Metropolitan Area as an active case study.  In the first part of the course, we will review existing models, including assumptions and data sources. Next, students will learn how to build their own system dynamics models using VenSim®.  A major Team Project component acts as a Practicum: student teams tackle real cities and regions, then compare and contrast findings.  As well as elucidating interdependencies, models will explore the implications of future climate scenarios projected by the IPCC.  In the last part of the course, we will explore adaptation measures including policy interventions that would enhance the sustainability of water resources.</p>

<p>The course is designed to attract students from ES&amp;P, ID, CDP, GIS, and Geography programs.  It serves as an elective for several IDCE concentrations:  Climate Change Impacts &amp; Adaptation, Environment &amp; Development, Urban Resilience, and Health People/Healthy Planet.  It is also a Methods/Skills class; employers increasingly value the ability of graduates to model systems.</p>

<p><strong>SECTION 02- TITLE: THE SCIENCE AND PRACTICE OF THE SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS (SDGs) </strong></p>

<p>(One Unit)</p>

<p>In 2016, the governments from around the world agreed to 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) to mobilize efforts to end all forms of poverty, fight inequalities, and tackle climate change, while ensuring that no one is left behind. In this course, we will look at the origin and key concepts of sustainability and the nature and relevance of the SDGs. Through a series of case studies, we will then examine how the SDGs are understood by different actors and across levels of governance, investigate the strategies and applications focused on achieving the SDGs, and consider challenges related to the measurement of progress. This course is multidisciplinary in nature and experientially-focused. This course is designed to span IDCE concentrations through projects that fit within any given IDCE graduate concentration.</p>

<p><strong>SECTION 03- Title: THE NEC COUNCIL COLLABORATIVE</strong></p>

<p>(Half Unit)</p>

<p>The NEC Council Collaborative introduces students to the theory and practice of council, deepens their engagement with the literature of climate change, and prepares them to help facilitate sessions of the Council on the Uncertain Human Future.</p>

<p>As a collaborative, the course is shared and horizontally organized. Conducted as a council and beginning with the CUHF process, its further structure and content are generated collectively, building especially on questions and problems generated by the students in the initial sessions.</p>

<p>Council practice is at the core of the New Earth Conversation, a curriculum initiative at Clark designed to explore the role of universities in the context of our unfolding climate disaster.</p>

<p>NEC asks, What are universities called to be and to do at this moment? How can we best prepare students to face the existential challenges of these times? The Council Collaborative goes to the heart of these concerns, while modeling one distinctive way of answering them.</p>

<p>Before enrolling in this course, students must have participated in one or more UHF Councils and receive permission of the instructors.<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> Annually<br><br></p></div>		</td>
