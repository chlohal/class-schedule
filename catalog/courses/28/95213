<div><h3>PSCI 121 - State Government and Politics </h3>  <p><hr>Â </p>

<p>In this introduction to the study of state government and politics in the United States, we will explore the how state governments impact a wide array of aspects of peoples&#8217; lives, from driving a car, to marriage and family, to protecting the environment, and many others. What is the relationship between the politics of the fifty states and the politics of the nation as a whole? Do innovations in public policy flow from the states to Washington, from Washington to the states, or some of each? Who are the people who run for state elective office, and what motivates them to run and to serve? What role do money, media, and citizen activism play in influencing state laws and policies, and does this differ from state to state? The class will include both lectures and class discussions.
