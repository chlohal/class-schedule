<div><h3>MCA 283 - Arts Journalism-Reporting & Reviewing the Arts and Culture </h3>  <p><hr>Arts journalism has long occupied a prominent place among newspapers and magazines, radio and television, and more recently the online world.  While news and sports reports mainly give the reader/listener/viewer information, stories and reviews in the arts usually provide their consumers with enlightenment-an understanding of what&#8217;s involved in the creative process, the people doing the creating, and, in the case of reviews, how the finished products present themselves.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>In this course, your writing will do exactly that kind of writing as you explore the range of the arts on the Clark campus and in the community beyond.  You will visit arts venues around Worcester and spend time with reporters and editors at the Telegram and Gazette.</p>

<p> <br><br><strong>Course Designation/Attribute:</strong> POP<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> Every other spring semester<br><br></p></div>		</td>
