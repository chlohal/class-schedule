<div><h3>MGMT 4200 - Advanced Organizational Leadership </h3>  <p><hr>This course is designed to strengthen the leadership capabilities of students who already have significant experience working as individual contributors or team leaders. Students will develop leadership competencies that boost their personal effectiveness and help them excel in roles where they must get results through others. Students will gain an understanding of leadership challenges and skill requirements across levels of the organization, as well as the process of leadership development. Major foci include: 1) building relationships (e.g., resolving conflict, influencing others, adapting across cultures), 2) managing direct reports (e.g., transitioning into a management role, delegating, selecting employees, evaluating performance, developing employees), 3) getting results (e.g., facilitating team performance, managing up, implementing change), and 4) developing one&#8217;s career. Readings, lectures, self-assessments, classroom activities, and assignments will be used to be used to facilitate learning. Students will actively link course teachings to their on-the-job experiences.</p>
