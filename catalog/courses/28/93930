<div><h3>PSCI 092 - Women and War </h3>  <hr>This first-year seminar is part of the International Studies Stream (ISS): &#8220;to succeed in contemporary society, students must be familiar with the ways common problems such as economic growth, immigration, social welfare, environmental regulation are dealt with differently across the globe. They need to understand the historical, social and political foundations for these differences, and they need to be able to assess their own societies within an international context.&#8221; That said, this first-year seminar examines the impact of war on women as both victims (i.e. refugees, rape victims) and participants (i.e. warriors) as part of the larger understanding of women&#8217;s role in society, both domestic and international society. The course will introduce students to the theoretical approaches in international relations for understanding the connection between gender and war. Various case studies of wars will be explored. Questions to be considered include: How do we understand gender, particularly in conflict situations? Does war affect women and men differently? If so, how? How does militarization and conflict perpetuate patriarchal power arrangements? What can the various case studies tell us about women&#8217;s role in society before, during and after conflict and war?<br><br><strong>Course Designation/Attribute:</strong> GP<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> Offered periodically<br><br></div>		</td>
