<div><h3>CJ 2050 - Forensic Science </h3>  <hr>What is forensic science? Is it really what we see on CSI and other similar shows? We will answer these questions as well as examine the major issues surrounding forensic science, its capabilities as well as its weaknesses. We will combine the technical aspects of several of the individual disciplines within forensic science with the major current issues pertaining to each particular discipline. We will look closely at the National Academy of Science&#8217;s (NAS) publication Strengthening Forensic Science in the United States- A Path Forward which will have a tremendous impact on the future of forensic science. You won&#8217;t be a forensic scientist when the course is over but you will be well educated and knowledgeable about the basics of forensic sciences and be able to judge for yourself the credibility of the science used in crime scene investigation.<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> varies<br><br></div>		</td>
