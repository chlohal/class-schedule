<div><h3>GEOG 372 - Seminar on Contemporary Environmental Issues in Forest Ecosystems </h3>  <hr>Forests are among the most important ecosystems on Earth and they are being greatly affected by climate change and human activities. Understanding how ecosystems function and how they change in response to human activities and fluctuations in the Earth system are important goals of contemporary geographical and ecological research. Beyond having inherent scientific value, such inquiries have become integral to national and international policies and practices of ecosystem management. This graduate-level seminar considers contemporary research themes in the field of forest ecology. The seminar will examine primary literature dealing with topics such as the effects of climate change on forest ecosystems and the causes and consequences of natural and anthropogenic disturbances in forest ecosystems.<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> Offered every year<br><br></div>		</td>
