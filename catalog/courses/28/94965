<p>Topics in Urban Geography engages a substantive theme within urban geography and cognate disciplines, focusing first on theorizations of the theme, then substantive empirical investigations of it.<span>  </span>Over the course of the semester, doctoral students will read a range of scholarly texts and will place them in two regards: first, in the broader historical and conceptual sweep of urban geographical scholarship; and second, in critical engagement with the goals, methods, and contributions of the specific work in the subfield.<span>  </span>Since the particular topic in a given semester will vary, doctoral students can take the course more than once for credit, as long as the subtitle is different from a previously taken course. Open for doctoral and masters students. Open to doctoral students, others by permission only.</p>

<p><span>In the topics seminar subtitled &#8220;Urban Politics,&#8221; we will consider fundamental contemporary scholarship and debates around urban politics and urban geography.<span>  </span>We will interrogate the intersections of urban geography and political geography, focusing on themes related to: citizenship, place identity, state theory, and urban governance.<span>  </span>Our overall goal is to understand the ways that scholars, particularly within or in dialogue with urban geography, conceptualize &#8220;politics&#8221; and citizen-state-subjectivity relations</span>.</p>
