<div><h3>HGS 250 - Antropology of War and Genocide </h3>  <hr>This graduate course takes two approaches to the anthropology of war and genocide. First, anthropology is the study of culture - the practices, the customs, sensibilities and attitudes - that constitute societies and groups as such in their particularities. When societies break down and engage in war, the question of culture comes up. How has a convivial society with certain cultural practices turned to extreme violence? After war and genocide, a related question comes up: &#8220;can cultural practices help reconciliation, justice, truth finding and aid in overcoming trauma and violent memories?&#8221; Second, anthropology is also the study of the species human in its social and political environment. What kind of political and social environment do war and genocide create? How does that change preconceived notions of the human and humanity?<br><br><strong>Course Designation/Attribute:</strong> VP, DI<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> Spring 2022<br><br></div>		</td>
