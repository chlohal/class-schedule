<div><h3>PSYC 060 - Education and Effective Practice </h3>  <hr>What is the best form and structure for education in these times? How do we best improve the quality and intellectual aims of education? To what extent are our current educational institutions utilizing the growing knowledge base about how people learn?Â  Is education a right and does it equitably deliver on the promise of providing a well-balanced citizenship for democracy? These and other questions will be the focus of this First Year Intensive seminar. The course will consider what we currently know about human learning in formal and informal settings and map that onto the educational institutions of our times, with special focus on secondary and college environments. This course is designed to deepen students&#8217; ability to read analytically and communicate with others about one of the most enduring issues of our times. Simultaneously, the course aims to improve first year students&#8217; ability to reflect on the differences in their learning contexts as they transition from high school to college.<br><br><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> VE Placement<br><br><strong>Course Designation/Attribute:</strong> VE<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> Bi-annually<br><br></div>		</td>
