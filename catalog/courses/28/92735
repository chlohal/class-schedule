<p>Fall 2021 Topic: EXPLORING FIGURATION</p>

<p>In this course, we will explore figuration. Figurative art is a term used to describe artwork that retains a strong reference to the real form, particularly the human form. We will move from figure drawing through the basic elements of movement, design, line, color, light, mass, volume, etc. We will explore the human figure to create an impression or illusion of form and space, as we put emphasis on the narrative of what we are portraying. By means of observational drawing, photographs, and imagination, students will interpret and express their vision in a variety of materials including acrylic, oil, tempera paint, watercolor, ink, charcoal, paper, and canvas as well as a variety of experimental media that will enable them to achieve their visual goals.</p>
