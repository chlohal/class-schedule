<div><h3>PHIL 121 - Science Fiction and Philosophy </h3>  <hr>This course takes advantage of the significant convergence of topics and issues entertained both by science fiction literature and by philosophical debate. Course topics are wide ranging and may include the possibility and ethics of artificial intelligence, time travel and the question of free will and determinism, political liberalism and Rawls&#8217; veil of ignorance, the persistence of persons over time, gender and identity, post-apocalyptic scenarios (including pandemics) and the social compact, the possibility of alien intelligence and the nature of persons, including their moral status. Most broadly, however, both science fiction and philosophy affords us an opportunity to consider what it is to be a human being. Students will read and discuss works in science fiction, as well as works by philosophers addressing similar topics. No previous experience with either philosophy or the literature of speculative fiction is necessary.<br><br><strong>Course Designation/Attribute:</strong> VP<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> Probably either once every three semesters or bi-annually<br><br></div>		</td>
