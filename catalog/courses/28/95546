<div><h3>SOC 005 - Health Inequalities in Europe and the United States </h3>  <p><hr>Course being offered in Luxembourg May 2020</p>

<p>&#8220;Social injustice is killing people on a grand scale&#8221;- WHO Commission on the Social Determinants of Health, 2008.</p>

<p>Differences in health that are unjust are greater in the United States compared to European countries. What makes us sick is influenced by where people are born, grow, live, work and age.  Structural factors beyond our control such as money, power, and resources at global, national local levels shape the length and quality of our lives.  In this course, we will examine health inequities in Europe and the United States and the social conditions that affect our health.  We will also compare and contrast the health public policies focused on individual lifestyle factors (smoking, physical exercise, and diet) in the United States and European countries.  In addition, the students will have the opportunity to combine theory and praxis through field trips to various local health related organizations and visits with health care practitioners in the community - moving away from a classroom-centered environment in order to learn more about approaches to health and health care outside the U.S. Field trips will include visits to organizations focused on health and well-being and the Ministry of Health in Luxembourg, a major hospital facility in France, and other sites in the region.</p>
