<div><h3>PSYC 325 - Intersectional Psychology </h3>  <p><hr>What is intersectionality theory? How can psychologists integrate intersectionality theory into the field to promote social justice? There is burgeoning interest in intersectionality in psychology, which presents psychologists with a unique opportunity to focus on interlocking systems of oppression and structural-level issues. This course delves into intersectionality theory through its Black feminist scholar-activist origins and provides a lens for psychologists to understand how to promote social justice and equity in the field. Drawing on interdisciplinary scholarship, students will be encouraged to develop a critical understanding of how intersections of race, class, gender, and sexual oppression can be used to explore important issues in psychology.</p>
