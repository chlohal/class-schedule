<div><h3>HIST 377 - America&#8217;s Founding Fathers: Memory and Meaning </h3>  <p><hr>Using the &#8220;Founding Fathers&#8221; paradigm as a focus, this pro-seminar in American political and cultural history explores the transmission of Revolutionary values across generations in the United States. Students will first explore the eighteenth-century world of the Founders themselves, with considerable emphasis on John Adams and Thomas Jefferson, before assessing their visible presence, individually and collectively, in the lives of later generations of Americans and the larger public culture. We will focus our attention in the latter part of the course on issues and controversies of urgent present-day concern, including the Second Amendment and gun control as well as the complicated relationship among region, race, and American nationality.</p>
