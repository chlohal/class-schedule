<div><h3>HIST 281 - China since 1949: State, Economy and Family in the People&#8217;s Republic </h3>  <hr>This course explores China&#8217;s historical development from the founding of the People&#8217;s Republic (PRC) in 1949 through the early years of the 21st century. Rather than attempting to cover all aspects of PRC history, the course focuses on three interconnected themes: the nature of the modern state, the shift from a socialist to post-socialist economy, and the changing dynamics of family life. Topics include agrarian revolution and land reform in the 1950s, the impact of the Great Leap Forward and the Cultural Revolution, the economic reform program of the 1980s and 1990s, political protest, family change, and the role of migrant labor in China&#8217;s growing economy. We shall investigate these issues through a variety of sources: scholarly monographs, primary documents, fiction, ethnography, memoir, feature film, and documentaries. While there are no formal prerequisites, some background in Asian studies and/or 20th century history is highly recommended.<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> Offered every other year<br><br></div>		</td>
