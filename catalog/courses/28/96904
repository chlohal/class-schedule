<div><h3>GART 210 - Drawing II </h3>  <hr>This course is a follow-up studio course that continues to solidify and expand the basic drawing concepts that students explored in GART 100 Principles of Drawing. The student will be working with wet media techniques (watercolors, oils, markers) as they develop their drawing, and painting techniques in creating 2D objects and more complex subject matter. Students also learn the relationship of plain objects, figures and animals, and their relationship to an environment or composition.<br><br><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> GART 100<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> Fall<br><br></div>		</td>
