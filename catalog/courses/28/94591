<div><h3>ECON 1010 - Economics and the World Economy </h3>  <hr>The last few years have proven to all of us that what happens in one nation&#8217;s economy can have major impact- good or bad- on the economies of another nation. How and why this happens is important for us to understand. Comparisons across countries provide a deeper understanding of business cycles, unemployment, monetary policy, economic growth, currencies and fiscal policy This course, an introduction to international economic interactions and the macroeconomic analysis of economies, develops basic economic concepts including market analysis, trade, and demand and supply in the macroeconomy. These economic concepts provide tools to analyze current issues such as economic stability, debt crises and policies towards trade.<br><br><strong>Course Designation/Attribute:</strong> GP (summer only)<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> various<br><br></div>		</td>
