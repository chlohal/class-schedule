<p>SPECIAL TOPIC Spring 2022 - &#8220;Tomes of Solid Witchcraft&#8221;: Major Women Poets</p>

<p>This course examines how women speak poetically to each other across time, beyond the confines of what Virginia Woolf called the &#8220;private house.&#8221; We view them as originators of meaning, thematically broaching issues of identity, society, religion, politics, and what it means to be intelligent, articulate, and transcendent of cultural circumstance and restraint. Poems read will be drawn from Charlotte Smith, Emily Bronte, Christina Rossetti, Emily Dickinson, Sylvia Plath, Denise Levertov, Mary Oliver and Joy Harjo.</p>
