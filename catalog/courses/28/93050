<div><h3>EN 290 - Capstone Research </h3>  <hr>A required course for senior environmental science and policy majors, this seminar offers an opportunity to integrate the strands of the environmental science and policy major. The product will be a completed research project and a poster presentation. A research proposal for an honors project or a master&#8217;s thesis is optional but strongly encouraged. Specific topics for investigation are chosen largely on the basis of student interest from a broad array including global environment threats, energy and other resource issues, community brownfields, and technological risk assessment and management. Unlike a regular course, student presentations constitute a major portion of class meetings, with the instructor as a facilitator of discussion and as a general resource for the group.<br><br><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Students must be seniors or second-semester juniors and must have completed a substantial fraction of their major requirements.<br><br></div>		</td>
