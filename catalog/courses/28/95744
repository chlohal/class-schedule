<p><strong>SECTION 01 TOPIC: RESEARCH IN GENDER &amp; BODY IMAGE - </strong>This course aims to prioritize women&#8217;s body experiences in psychological research and to better identify ways negative body experiences (body dissatisfaction, self-objectification, and social comparison) can be altered and improved. We will investigate the impact of a broad spectrum of sociocultural factors, including media, social media, family, peers, and cultural beliefs and messages on both disordered eating and eating disorder (ED) recovery trajectories. Current ongoing projects include a photographic exploration of the effect of COVID-19 and associated restrictions and life changes on women&#8217;s ED recovery experiences, the development and validation of new measures of body dissatisfaction and internalized weight stigma, and the adaptation and pilot-testing of a program to improve body satisfaction and reduce thin-ideal internalization amongst children. Research assistants will be involved in each phase of the research process, including conducting literature reviews, recruiting participants, and collecting and analyzing data.</p>

<p><strong>SECTION 02 TOPIC: DISPARITIES IN CHILDREN&#8217;S HEALTH CARE MANAGEMENT- </strong>This course provides an opportunity to take part in research initiatives focused on disparities in asthma health care use. Students will be exposed to and participate in behavioral health research focused on ethnic minority and urban children and adolescents. A major focus of our work will be to apply a health disparities lens and critical race theory to understand children&#8217;s illness management, health care use, and  functioning and quality of life for children and their families. Students will be exposed to major components of mixed methods research  procedures integrating quantitative and qualitative data, including data collection, analyses, interpretation as well as manuscript development. <br><br><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> For 2021-2022 PSYC 101</p>
