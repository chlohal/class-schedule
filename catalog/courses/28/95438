<div><h3>GEOG 240 - Race and Urban Space </h3>  <hr>This course is about the ways in which race and racial difference have been central to the production of cities and everyday life in urban contexts. Ultimately, our goal is to gain a broader understanding of the relationship between social difference, space and power. Across our course readings there is a particular focus on Black urban life. However, given that race is inextricably linked to other categories of difference - gender, sexuality, class-our course attends to how people who inhabit multiple axes of difference both experience life in the city and produce new definitions of urbanity.<br><br><strong>Course Designation/Attribute:</strong> DI<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> bi-annually<br><br></div>		</td>
