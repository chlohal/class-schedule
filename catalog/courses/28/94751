<div><h3>PHIL 1330 - Business Ethics </h3>  <hr>In this course we will see how the qualities that make a company ethical are also those which can lead to the company&#8217;s success: the virtues of integrity, good management, and well established procedures of internal and external regulation. We will learn how successful enterprise balances its profit-making and risk-taking with regard to its employees,its share holders, its consumers and the environment. We will consider the issues of social justice inherent in business ethics: rights and responsibilities on personal, corporate, and international levels, and the issues of equity, fairness, discrimination and harassment.<br><br><strong>Course Designation/Attribute:</strong> VP (summer only)<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> -<br><br></div>		</td>
