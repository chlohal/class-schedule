<div><h3>IDCE 30338 - RUMORS, CONSPIRACIES, MISINFORMATION, AND HEALTH </h3>  <p><hr>Why do rumors and conspiracies attract so many believers despite facts and evidence? What are the implications of rumors, conspiracies, and mis/disinformation and beliefs on health? How do we, as community health practitioners, inform the population on these important health matters, despite some people&#8217;s unwillingness to believe the counter evidence? What information about race, governing, mistrust of science communicate about society.</p>

<p>In some situations, rumors can have a positive role, lending information on outbreaks, or conveying appropriate caution. But in others, they can have catastrophic effects on individual and community health leading to outbreaks of eradicated diseases and evasion of medical care.</p>

<p>The course will start by looking at the various theories that guide the discussions on rumors, conspiracies, and mis/disinformation, and ways that they are shared and spread. We will then look at specific &#8220;controversial&#8221; topics that include: vaccination; the spread of HIV/AIDS and other highly infectious diseases; reproductive health; immigrant &#8220;invasions&#8221;; zombies and vampires during colonialism; &#8220;alternative&#8221; therapies; organ theft/trafficking; &#8220;clean&#8221; eating and living; and climate change.</p>
