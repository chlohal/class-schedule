<div><h3>PSCI 079 - Model United Nations I </h3>  <hr>The Model United Nations program is a realistic simulation of the activities of ambassadors and representatives of different member nations who serve in various agencies of the United Nations. Students assume the role of ambassadors or special U.N. representatives. They participate in live simulations of the U.N. Security Council, Economic Social and Cultural Council, and Special Middle East Summit. Students participate in the Harvard Model U.N. Conference every year. During this conference, Clark students known as delegates enter the world of diplomacy, negotiation and high politics as they grapple with complex realities of peace and security, human rights, women&#8217;s rights and economic development, and they pit their skills against delegates from other universities representing different countries. Delegates prepare by thoroughly researching policy positions of countries they are representing and contribute to a lively exchange of ideas and simulate an authentic environment that parallels U.N. meetings. This active-learning experience complements classroom learning and prepares Clark students to enter a professional career in government, international organizations or the academe. Repeat registration allowed.<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> Offered every year<br><br></div>		</td>
