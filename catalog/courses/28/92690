<div><h3>ARTH 144 - Art Since 1970 </h3>  <p><hr>A survey of the major trends in art since 1970, focused primarily, but not exclusively, on the art scene in Europe and the United States. We will begin with the art movements of the 1970s that challenged the traditional definition of &#8220;a work of art,&#8221; including conceptualism and body art. The course will continue with the rise of postmodernism and the death (and resurrection) of the author through the expanded field of painting, sculpture, video, and installation art in recent decades. We will study this art in light of contemporary social and political concerns, such as feminism, the pervasiveness of commercial culture, and the increasing globalization of identity.</p>
