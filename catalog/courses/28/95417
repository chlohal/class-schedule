<div><h3>GEOG 340 - Graduate Seminar in Critical Mobilities </h3>  <hr>This course is a graduate reading seminar on the field of mobilities studies. In this seminar we trace genealogies, explore major debates in the field, and examine how various strands of critical theory have shaped the study of mobility. Our readings analyze not only the practice and experiences of mobility, but also the complex networks and infrastructures that engender and prohibit the movement of people, information, capital and material objects. Our course goals are (1) to develop a thorough understanding of how scholars have approached questions of movement and stasis (2) to think about opportunities for geographers to critically intervene upon and expand mobilities studies in the present. This course is open to graduate students only.<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> bi-annually<br><br></div>		</td>
