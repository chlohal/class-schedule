<div><h3>JS 117 - Reading the Narratives of the Hebrew Bible </h3>  <hr>The first half of the Hebrew Bible-the books of Genesis through Kings-is a central text of Western culture. But how are these texts to be read? As history, myth, religious program, foundation of Judaism, foundation of Christianity? Using the tools of comparative ancient Near eastern languages and cultures, the history of religion, literary analysis, and folklore, we will explore the Bible&#8217;s many faces, and try to show how the answer to the question is close to &#8220;all of the above.&#8221; We will also view the texts through the window of later interpretation among Jews and Christians, and see how many generations came to view themselves and their own story through the ones presented in the Bible. Fulfills the Historical Perspective requirement.<br><br><strong>Course Designation/Attribute:</strong> HP<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> Offered every year<br><br></div>		</td>
