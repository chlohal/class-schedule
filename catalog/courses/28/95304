<div><h3>MATH 112 - The Mathematics of Voting and Social Choice </h3>  <hr>Who should have won the 2000 Presidential Election?  Should there be multiple rounds of voting to determine the winner in an election?  Can we determine how a voting system can be manipulated?  While these questions are of interest to many social scientists, a mathematical perspective can also offer deep insights.  In this course, we will discuss the advantages and disadvantages of various types of voting systems, as well as issues related to polling and gerrymandering, and to &#8220;representation&#8221; more broadly.  The main objective will be to convince you that no voting system can ever be truly &#8220;fair,&#8221; and to understand why that is the case.  <em>No background in mathematics is required other than some familiarity with basic logic and with symbols and variables; in particular, there is no calculus in this course</em>. Therefore, students whose primary interest is in the social sciences or the humanities are absolutely welcome and encouraged to attend. <em>Formally MATH 127</em><br><br><strong>Course Designation/Attribute:</strong> GP, DI<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> Fall 2021<br><br></div>		</td>
