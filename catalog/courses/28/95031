<div><h3>HIST 2240 - People&#8217;s Republic of China:1949-Present </h3>  <hr>A general survey of the People&#8217;s Republic of China from the Manchu Dynasty in 1911 and the emergence of the Chinese Civil War and the Chinese Communist Revolution of 1949 to the present. Involves a detailed chronological overview of the historical events and causes leading up to the 1949 Revolution, the origins of the Chinese Communist ideology known as Maoism, the struggle of the Chinese Communist Party in the early years to collectivize agriculture and to industrialize, the Great Leap Forward, the Five Year Plans and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. We will attempt to penetrate the Chinese village in order to understand traditional rural culture and the nature of peasant society. In addition, we will emphasize the historical and ideological evolution of the CCP with special emphasis on Mao and the post-Mao era.<br><br><strong>Course Designation/Attribute:</strong> HP (summer only)<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> varies<br><br></div>		</td>
