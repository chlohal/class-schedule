<div><h3>GERM 286 - German-Jewish Culture and Modern Multiculturalism </h3>  <hr>This class studies the expression of cultural identity in central European literature. How have people in central Europe come to think of themselves or others as &#8220;Germans,&#8221; &#8220;Jews,&#8221; &#8220;Turks,&#8221; or some combinations thereof? While the Holocaust is obviously central to the German-Jewish relationship, it is not the only focus of this course-we will also study the emancipation of the Jews in the German-speaking world, German-Jewish assimilation and symbiosis, the rise of anti-Semitism and Zionism, as well as attempts to remember the Holocaust. And while the long history of the relationship between Jews and non-Jews in Germany will be a major component of our course, we will also study the emergence of Turkish culture in the German-speaking world and conclude with reflections on Germany today as a multicultural nation.<br><br><strong>Course Designation/Attribute:</strong> HP & DI<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> Offered periodically<br><br><strong>Placement Guidelines</strong><br> Taught in English<br><br></div>		</td>
