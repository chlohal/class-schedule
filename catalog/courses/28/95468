<div><h3>HIST 1200 - American History Through Film </h3>  <p><hr><strong>SUMMER 2018: American History Through Film 1870-1985</strong></p>

<p>The history of the United States has long been a canvas upon which filmmakers have painted an ever evolving picture of the American experience. Â This course will use films about the American past as a jumping off point to discuss the ways in which American history has been portrayed on the silver screen, as well as exploring themes and important moments in American history more broadly speaking. One note that needs to be made at the beginning: this is not a film course in the traditional sense. The technical aspects of film making and the finer points of the cinematic craft will not be the main thrust of the course discussions (though it may come up from time to time).</p>

<p><em>May be repeatable for credit once for a maximum of two units of credit.</em><br><br><strong>Course Designation/Attribute:</strong> HP (summer only)<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> summer<br><br></p></div>		</td>
