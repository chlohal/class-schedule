<div><h3>PSCI 070 - Introduction to Comparative Politics </h3>  <hr>The study of comparative politics is based upon the premise that we can better understand domestic political dynamics and political phenomena in general, by comparing political conditions across and within (subnational units) countries. Specifically, comparative politics investigates the following types of questions: In what ways do groups and individuals participate in politics? Why have some countries developed stable democratic political systems, while others remain authoritarian or experience frequent changes in government? What relationship does a country&#8217;s political organization have with its economic performance, social stability and relations with other countries? In exploring these questions, we will compare both developed and developing countries in terms of political institutions (constitutions, executives, legislatures, courts and political parties), political behavior (voting and collective action), political culture and political economy.
