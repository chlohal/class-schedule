<p> Spring 2022 Topic: 17C Dutch Art and Society</p>

<p>During the 17th century, the Dutch became a world power, laying the foundation for much of our modern world.  This course will examine the society of the northern Netherlands as documented in one of its greatest legacies, the visual arts. We will learn how the rich and the rising middle class became the main client of Dutch artists and influenced a wide array of subjects that provide insight into this new republic. We will study the many achievements of 17th-century Dutch society, from the country&#8217;s dominance in world trade and corporate finance to its major advancements in science and global exploration. This course will also examine the role of religion in a country dominated by Protestantism and show how the &#8220;secular&#8221; art of the Dutch helped promote ethics and morality. The course is designed to introduce students to the leading 17th-century Dutch artists and to explore their work as a record of the early Dutch Republic. </p>
