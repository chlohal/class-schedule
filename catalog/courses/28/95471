<div><h3>MPA 3115 - Global Migration </h3>  <hr>Global Migration and Local Policy Impact: Â Almost every country has to deal with the consequences of migration, whether it is international or internal migration. This course looks at the push and pull reasons for migration and helps students understand the differences between refugees, asylum seekers, voluntary migrants, and undocumented immigrants. The course examines the theory and practice of people in transit through readings, case studies and discussions about migration, remittances, and ethnic minorities migrating out of and within countries. The course delves into how the flow of people become local administrative issues when larger groups of people settle in specific areas and potential remedies and solutions.<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> Varied<br><br></div>		</td>
