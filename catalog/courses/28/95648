<div><h3>ARTS 118 - Sourcing Creative Power:Drawing & Meditation </h3>  <hr>Drawing can be a catalyst for discovering our authentic direction as artists. The speed of society can make it difficult to slow down and discover what our creative truth is. This course will teach basic meditation techniques and investigate how artists use contemplative methods to deepen their practice. In response to contemporary themes relevant to our human condition, drawings will be generated through experimental mark making, drawing to sound, intuitive drawing, drawing from memory, poetry, sensory connection and kinesthetic image making. The integration of drawing and meditation will lead to a meaningful body of work and build a sustainable creative practice for a lifetime. Exploring with a wide range of materials, this course is suitable for all levels of experience.<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> annually<br><br></div>		</td>
