<div><h3>CYES 108 - Identity and Social Change within Higher Education </h3>  <hr>What is &#8220;higher education&#8221;? What is the difference between high school and college, and how are students co-creators and participants of these spaces? How have my identities and lived experiences impacted my view of myself as a learner and producer of knowledge? What are some of the barriers that create inequities in the pipeline toward higher education, and how do we address those to expand access to underrepresented communities? These are the questions we will explore in the FYI course entitled Identity &amp; Social Change within Higher Education. This course will consist of hands-on projects, reflection, research, and discussions to position students to critically analyze higher education, using Clark as our classroom. This course will be open to first-year students enrolled in the ACE program, and is appropriate for all majors.<br><br><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Acceptance into the ACE (Advancing Clark Excellence) program<br><br><strong>Course Designation/Attribute:</strong> DI<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> Fall 2020<br><br></div>		</td>
