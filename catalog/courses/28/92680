<div><h3>ARTH 110 - Ancient Greek Art </h3>  <hr>This intensive survey reviews Greek art from the collapse of the Minoan-Mycenaean world in the 12th century B.C. to the close of the Hellenistic period in the first-century B.C. Geographically, it reaches from Greece, westward to the Greek cities of South Italy and Sicily and eastward to the Hellenized lands of Asia Minor, Egypt and the Near East. The course discusses the concept of artistic originality and stylistic development, the relationship between art and politics and the contribution of Greek art to the history of the visual arts in the Western world. Field trips to the Worcester Art Museum and the Boston Museum of Fine Arts.<br><br><strong>Course Designation/Attribute:</strong> AP<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> Offered every other year<br><br></div>		</td>
