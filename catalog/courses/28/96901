<div><h3>GAME 295 - Game Audio Production </h3>  <hr>The overall purpose of this course is to design and create a fully realized game audio production to be implemented in a working game, in tandem with the Senior Game Project course. The course involves creating all audio assets to be used in-game including sound-effects, music, and voice-overs, and the implementation of adaptive audio theories, real-time mixing, and middleware. Topics build on previous sound-design and composition courses. Students will work both individually and as a team. This course deepens the preparation of students for entry-level work in sound design and music at a game development company or as a freelance professional.<br><br><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> GAME 245 and GAME 250<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> Varies<br><br></div>		</td>
