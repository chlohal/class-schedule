While in teams under the supervision of a faculty instructor, students address an actual challenge faced by an organization of a department within an organization. Students study the issues, review industry trends, research the depth of the issue, and make a series of recommendations to key members of an organization. The practicum culminates in a formal written and oral presentation of the team&#8217;s work, which is evaluated by faculty and organization professionals.</p>
