<div><h3>NRES 300 - Nonresident Course </h3>  <hr>This non-graded course is for Nonresident students only.Â  A student must apply for nonresident status through their department. Nonresident status is for students who have completed all of their required course work but must still fulfill a graduation-related requirement (e.g., dissertation, thesis, fieldwork). Thus, it is unlikely that a nonresident student will register for courses again, although this is possible with the approval of the student&#8217;s advisor and the Dean of Research and Graduate Studies (or the Dean/Director of SOM, IDCE, SPS, or BSDT). Although students with non-resident status are not eligible to participate in or register for regular classes, they must register each semester as a non-resident student and pay the required non- resident fee. Students who fail to register and pay the fee will be withdrawn from the University and must request to be readmitted through their department. All full-time non-residents may defer their federal loans and must carry health insurance that meets the Massachusetts state law requirements. Note that part-time nonresident students are not eligible for loan deferments. Non-resident status is limited to three years or 1 year for students in an Accelerated Masters Degree Program.<br>
