<div><h3>EDUC 354 - Curriculum and Knowing: History and Social Science </h3>  <hr>The essential work of any historian or social scientist, whether a professional researcher or a kindergartener, is to carefully examine different documents and evidence to develop conclusions from them. Whether examining photos and maps in a first grade classroom or preparing students for a document based question on an advanced placement test, there is a similar process to engaging in this work. This Institute will explore different ways that teachers can help develop these skills in youthful historians. This Institute will take a workshop approach and offer hands-on activities and strategies for helping students to engage in the work that historians do. Throughout the course of the institute, we will look at how to integrate historical fiction, performance projects and off-site field experiences into the curriculum. Models at the elementary and secondary level will be offered while participants will begin to develop their own units in their respective content areas. Participants will share their experiences and results of implementing this process with students in the fall.<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> Summer<br><br></div>		</td>
