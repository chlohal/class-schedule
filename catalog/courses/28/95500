The goal is to better understand the tradeoffs, tensions, and debates regarding different advocacy options. In doing so, students will develop their ability to identify the various levels at which human rights advocacy interventions can or need to take place, including the possibly complementary or contradictory roles to be played by local, national, and international actors. Key skills covered through role-play and simulated advocacy exercises in combination with assignments that range from issue-monitoring and interviewing to writing for the media and preparing planning memos.<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> Bi-Annually<br><br></p></div>		</td>
