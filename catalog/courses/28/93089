<div><h3>ENG 245 - Mythopoetics </h3>  <hr>This course examines modes and qualities of literary expression where we will find that narratives and poetry convey different expectations, which are also embedded in a variety of worldviews. Frequently, however, authors will attempt to craft these expectations and worldviews to accommodate nontraditional visions. Toward this end, we will read works by authors who strive to come to grips with their own experiences of the world. For English majors and minors, this course satisfies the Theory (E) requirement.<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> Every year<br><br></div>		</td>
