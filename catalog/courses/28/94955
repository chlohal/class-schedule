<p><span style="font-family:'times new roman', serif;font-size:12pt;">Political Scientists spend considerable time researching and interpreting the relationships between nation-states, primarily international conflict and cooperation. Sports are one way to demonstrate those relationships between states. One need only think of the Olympic Games and the FIFA World Cup, for example, to reflect how players and spectators interpret sports within the context of national identities and international rivalries. Moreover, the international relations of sports is also gendered. With its focus on physical strength, camaraderie and competition, sports have long been understood as a benchmark for masculinity. This course will explore and examine several facets that connect the Political Science subfield/discipline of international relations with sports: globalization, diplomacy, war/conflict, identity and place, and the intersectionality of race, ethnicity, and gender.</span></p>
