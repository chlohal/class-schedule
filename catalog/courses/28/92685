<div><h3>ARTH 125 - Art in the Age of Michelangelo </h3>  <hr>Focuses on the art of the 1500s in Italy, an era comprising the High Renaissance and Mannerism, perhaps the single most influential period in Western art after classical times. Investigates painting, sculpture and architecture in the major Italian cultural centers of Florence, Rome, Milan, Parma, Mantua and Venice. Considers questions of style, influence, patronage, art theory and scholarly and religious developments. Highlights the work of Michelangelo, including the recently restored Sistine Chapel frescoes, the Medici Tombs, the David and the Piet√†. Also considers the work of Leonardo da Vinci, Raphael, Correggio, Giorgione and Titian, and their relationship to Michelangelo and his legacy. Looks at the rise of papal Rome and the building of St. Peter&#8217;s basilica and the Vatican palaces.
