<div><h3>MSPC 3770 - Political Communication </h3>  <hr>This course offers an introduction to political communication, a preeminently practical activity whose role in informing, influencing and legitimizing decisions is crucial to both domestic and international politics. The course looks at fundamental themes of political communication, such as agenda setting, framing, and branding. The course also looks at relevant media formats - infotainment for example - or trends - the emotive news - or technology - the new media. This course is based on the idea that to achieve effective political communication it is necessary to know how media work in general and in the context of politics, and how citizens, journalists and politicians make sense of and use political messages.<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> varied<br><br></div>		</td>
