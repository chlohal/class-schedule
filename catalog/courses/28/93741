<div><h3>MGMT 260 - Applying the Art and Science of Management (Capstone) </h3>  <p><hr>Strategic Management is concerned with the senior management or general management perspective of decision making in organizations. Strategy formulation and implementation at this level considers all aspects of the organization, both internal and external.  These decisions occur in a complex environment of economic, social, political, and legal forces, all affecting the total enterprise. Understanding the cross- functional effects and consequences of situations, problems, or decisions and the long- and short-term implications for all areas of the organization is essential in senior level decision-making.</p>

<p>This course links and further develops the knowledge and skills you have gained in previous courses that focused on specific functional areas such as accounting, finance, management, and marketing.  The comprehensive knowledge base is the foundation for the formulation and analysis of how an organization sets its direction, chooses its business activities, and establishes and defends its competitive position in the market. The course will introduce students to the concepts and tools used in strategy formulation, the implementation of decisions, and the development of competitive advantage in organizations.</p>
