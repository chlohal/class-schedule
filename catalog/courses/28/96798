<div><h3>PSYC 245 - TRUE CRIME: Gender, Race, and Sexuality as Lenses </h3>  <p><hr>This course focuses on the role of gender, sexuality, and race-and their intersections-in the reality and (mis)representation of crime. This course seizes on the accelerating and persistent cultural fascination with true crime, as made evident by the recent explosion in true crime media, including documentaries and podcasts. Blending critical readings, empirical research, pop culture, and media analysis, and drawing from multiple disciplines (psychology, sociology, criminology, media studies, communication), it assumes an intersectional lens to consider why true crime is so popular as a genre, and with whom.</p>

<p>We will examine true crime stories, both high-profile and little-known, and those stories will be used to explore issues related to stigma, visibility, violence, sexuality, and intersectionality, as well as the relationship between agency (i.e., the individual) and social structures and systems (e.g., the legal system). We will center gender, race, sexuality, and class in examining both the reality and representation of true crime-for example, research on, narratives about, and media representations of missing children, trans women murders, and women serial killers. In this way, we will consider offending and victimology (e.g., why do women kill?) as well as ideas about and representations of female murderers (e.g., White women like Amanda Knox are positioned as &#8220;femme fatales&#8221;). We will explore true crime cases through an intersectional lens, taking stock of not only who and what highlighted in crime, but what is invisible in the accounting, representation, or societal focus surrounding the case. Dominant media narratives can impact how jury members, policy makers, and the general public view women, people of color, and LGBTQ people; in turn, we also consider the individual and societal impacts of true crime and its representation.</p>
