<div><h3>IDCE 307 - Qualitative Research Methods for Policy Design and Analysis </h3>  <hr>This course will prepare students to conduct qualitative research that informs the design and analysis of Social Policy. It will explore how qualitative research methods are utilized to advance the field&#8217;s understanding of the causes and consequences of poverty and inequality, and how this kind of policy research can inform the development of policy alternatives. Research techniques to be covered in the course include: question formulation; data collection and field methods such as interviews, surveys, focus groups, and participant observation; case study research; and community and participatory action research. The course also includes a semester-long policy research simulation based on a current policy issue. The simulation will teach students how to design qualitative research studies that can inform policy implementation decisions.<br><br><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Jrs. &amp; Srs.
