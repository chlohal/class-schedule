<div><h3>PSCI 178 - Gender and Political Theory </h3>  <hr>This course will examine the explicit and implicit assumptions about gender made by some of the major political thinkers of the Western Tradition. The objective of this course is to explore how reading classic political theory texts with an eye to gender can yield unique insights and foster critical thinking about political ideas and arguments. Emphasis will be placed on the ways in which re-reading canonical texts can enrich contemporary debates about subjects like freedom, citizenship, equality, and representation. Through these readings and class discussions, this course will examine the way in which gender intersects with other lenses, including but not limited to race and class.<br><br><strong>Course Designation/Attribute:</strong> DI<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> Occasionally<br><br></div>		</td>
