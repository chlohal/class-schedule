<div><h3>HIST 128 - History of Modern Israel </h3>  <hr>This course surveys the history of modern Israel, from the emergence of Zionism in the late-nineteenth century to contemporary questions about peace, politics, religion, and culture in Israeli society. Examining historical writing, literature, and a range of other primary sources, we will trace the development of the Jewish national idea as a source of social criticism, as the basis for collective action and personal discipline, and as the inspiration for religious and artistic innovation. Assessing Israeli history in its local, Middle Eastern, and global contexts, we will explore the making of Israeli politics, state, and government; the role of religion in society; the impact of the Arab-Israeli conflict; gender in Israeli society; and Israeli literature, music, food, and art. <br><br><strong>Course Designation/Attribute:</strong> HP<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> Offered bi-annually<br><br></div>		</td>
