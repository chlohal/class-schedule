<div><h3>ARTS 162 - Exploring the Natural World: Seeding Artistic Process with Drawing and Mixed Media </h3>  <p><hr>This class explores the natural world as visual model and studies organic process as a metaphor for artistic process. With close observation of Nature&#8217;s forms and structures, students sharpen their eyes and experiment with different field-drawing techniques. Numerous drawing expeditions produce a collection of images to use as seeds for finished work. Students are encouraged to experiment with a variety of materials and create an individual final project in one or more of the media covered.</p>

<p>Students will be charged a V &amp; PA lab fee upon registering for this course.<br><br><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Basic drawing skills required.<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> Offered every year<br><br></p></div>		</td>
