<div><h3>ARTH 124 - Italian Art from Giotto to Botticelli </h3>  <hr>Examines one of the most crucial periods in Western art, the Early Renaissance in Italy. Investigates painting, sculpture and architecture in their cultural and historical contexts from the trecento (1300s) to the late quattrocento (1400s), with a focus on Tuscany and its flourishing capital, Florence. Explores the movement away from Byzantine and Gothic art toward a new, uniquely Italian style emphasizing humanity, realism and science. Assesses how humanist studies, republican politics, monastic reform and the emergence of a wealthy mercantile class affected artistic style and theory. Considers artistsâ€š growing self-awareness as professionals contributing to contemporary intellectual developments and the ideology of genius. Artists highlighted in this course include Giotto, Brunelleschi, Donatello, Alberti, Mantegna, Piero della Francesca and Botticelli.
