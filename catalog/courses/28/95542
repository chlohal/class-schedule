<div><h3>PSYC 327 - Advanced Cognitive Development </h3>  <p><hr>Â </p>

<p>This course is intended to familiarize the student with major theories, issues, and research associated with the study of cognitive development and functioning across the lifespan. The coverage of topics is non-exhaustive and reflects the instructor&#8217;s opinions of the importance and quality of research as well as personal interests. For each topic, the readings are designed to provide a foundational background as well as representational research in the area. For each session there will be substantive areas covered as well as focus on a specific methodological/statistical issue in developmental research. We will also focus on critical thinking skills and evaluating primary source materials - both critique of work and finding the merit.<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> Bi-annually<br><br></p></div>		</td>
