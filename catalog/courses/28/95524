<div><h3>ID 254 - Mega Development:  Exploring the nexus between natural resource extraction, infrastructure development and Environment </h3>  <hr>Across the planet, countries, led by the G-20, promote multi-billion dollar investments in natural resource extraction and large-scale infrastructure development, including: mines, oil and gas fields, hydroelectric power plants, dams, multi-modal transport systems, pipelines and port facilities. Increasing investment in natural resource extraction and infrastructure development is regularly promoted as a pathway to economic growth in the global south. However, investment in mega-projects is often accompanied by corruption, increased inequality, environmental harm and human rights violations. In this seminar, students will conduct research on specific mega-projects and initiatives to understand the socio-political and economic dynamics that drive them, explore the synergistic relationship between investments in infrastructure and extraction, the emergence of socio-environmental conflict linked mega-projects, and learn of the initiatives of business, government and civil society actors to reduce negative impacts pursue alternative, more sustainable forms of development.  <br><br><strong>Prerequisites:</strong>  junior/senior standing only; with permission of instructor<br><br><strong>Course Designation/Attribute:</strong> GP, POP<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> Bi-annually<br><br></div>		</td>
