<div><h3>MSCS 3999 - Capstone </h3>  <p><hr>The course is structured as a consulting experience, with specific instructions, primarily during the first few weeks of the term on interpersonal aspects of the interaction of the Consultant and his/her Client and on the process of ensuring that the Consultant is working on the &#8220;right problem&#8221; commonly known as requirements gathering.</p>

<p>The intent of the course structure is to give the student the experience of applying the knowledge acquired in the classroom courses of the MSCS Program, along with the experience they bring, and apply the to a real world problem on behalf of a real client with an actual need. Students be assigned client and project from a list of organizations this course has obtained. Working in teams of 2-4, students will receive a request from a client, develop a Statements of Requirements, develop a simplified contract with the client, research possible solutions develop a reference architecture linking the clients existing system or process with the new or replacement capability and make a recommendation in addition to providing the appropriate supporting documentation.</p>

<p>If this process is successful, the students will gain not only the experience but also take away a meaningful detail for their resume and a Client who could provide a future reference.<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> Annually<br><br></p></div>		</td>
