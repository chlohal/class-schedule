<div><h3>GAME 260 - Serious Game Project </h3>  <hr>This course is the capstone course for the Context component of the interactive media curriculum and is thematically connected with the experience component. Students are required to link their humanities and social science work with their interactive media studies. Teams of students work on game projects that are designed for a primary purpose other than pure entertainment. The &#8220;serious&#8221; adjective generally refers to applications that have been designed for use by industries like defense, education, scientific exploration, health care, emergency management, city planning, engineering, and politics. These projects draw heavily on the outcomes students have mastered as a result of their general education courses.<br><br><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> GAME 010 and at least two semesters fo GAME 255<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> Fall & Spring<br><br></div>		</td>
