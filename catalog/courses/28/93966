<div><h3>PSCI 216 - Comparative Environmental Politics </h3>  <hr>Over the course of the past several decades environmental degradation and sustainability have assumed major significance as public-policy issues, both within nations and internationally. However, given the transnational nature of many environmental problems, addressing such problems has proven to be particularly complex and difficult. This course examines the complex nature of environmental policy from both an international and comparative perspective. We will examine the specific challenges that the international nature of environmental problems poses for policy makers. We will also compare different national experiences and strategies for addressing environmental issues with an eye toward identifying the factors, which impede or facilitate success in promoting effective environmental policy.<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> Offered every other year<br><br></div>		</td>
