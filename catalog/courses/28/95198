<div><h3>PSYC 1530 - Human Development Across the Lifespan </h3>  <p><hr>This course will explore theory and research on human development from conception through old age. Areas of development considered will include biological, cognitive, and emotional functioning, as well as relationships with family members, peers and friends, and romantic partners. The course will draw on theory and research in psychology as well as sociology and anthropology. The cultural approach to development will be emphasized, that is, human development will be portrayed as taking markedly different paths depending on the cultural context.</p>
