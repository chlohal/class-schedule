<div><h3>MUSC 133 - Beginning a Music Career </h3>  <hr>In this course, students will learn to create a blueprint, based on their individual goals, for a successful and sustainable career in the modern music industry. We will practice and build the necessary skills and tools needed for a career in music - including best practices for performing, booking, creating a personal narrative, and marketing oneself as an independent musician. Students will learn how to use their personal narrative to market themselves, create an online presence, as well as setting and achieving attainable career goals. The course will cumulate in a final presentation of a basic music website with a completed recording, implementing biowriting techniques, professional branding &amp; coherent story-telling marketing skills acquired in the course.<br>
This is an introductory-level course, appropriate for students of all majors with some musical experience who are interested in exploring a career in music of all genres. This course is especially relevant for music majors and minors who intend to explore a career in music after graduation.<br><br><strong>Course Designation/Attribute:</strong> POP<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> bi-annually<br><br></div>		</td>
