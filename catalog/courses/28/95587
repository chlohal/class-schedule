<div><h3>CYES 200 - Special Topics </h3>  <p><hr>This &#8220;special topics&#8221; seminar combines (i) an in-depth examination of the concept of epistemic injustice, and theories of social inequality as they relate to epistemic injustice, with (ii) fieldwork to explore the theory/practice conundrum.  It also supports exploration into praxis &#8211; what it takes to disrupt community-based and educational settings in the service of epistemic justice.  Participants will read a variety of philosophical and social science texts, link theories of epistemic injustice to fieldwork in school and after-school settings, all in the service of promoting more equitable educational outcomes.</p>

<p>The seminar focuses on epistemic (or knowledge-building) tools designed to disrupt epistemic injustice.  A key goal is deepening understanding of epistemic tools as levers of change in teaching/learning contexts.  Readings will interrogate theories of social inequality - at the macro and micro level - with emphasis on the micro: the complexities of teaching and learning in urban classrooms for social justice.  In addition to the seminar, the class will also involve 3 hours per week of fieldwork in a teaching/learning site (TBD, depending on the site selected).</p>

<p>CYES 200 fulfills the CYES &#8220;Theories of Inequality&#8221; requirement or can be taken as an elective for the CYES major, minor, or Education minor. </p>

<p><strong>FALL 2021: SPECIAL TOPICS: STORIES OF SELF FOR TEACHERS</strong></p>

<p>How does our positionality - our personal identity in relation to our students and communities - impact our role as teachers and/or community workers? We&#8217;ll use personal narrative as a tool to explore our own positionalities and the role positionality can play in creating more equitable and engaged classrooms and community spaces.<br><br><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> <a href="preview_course_nopop.php?catoid=28&coid=92986" onclick="acalogPopup('preview_course.php?catoid=28&coid=92986&print', '3', 770, 530, 'yes');return false;" rel="remote /ajax/preview_course.php?catoid=28&coid=92986&display_options[location]=tooltip&show" id="tt1195" target="_blank">EDUC 152</a><span style="display: none !important">&#160;</span> <br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> Fall or Spring<br><br></p><div style="display: none; z-index: 1000;" class="tooltip for_tt1195"></div></div>		</td>
