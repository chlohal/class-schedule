<div><h3>ARTS 120 - Introduction to Photography </h3>  <p><hr>From the inception of the photographic arts, the darkroom has been at the heart of it all. Here at Clark University in the Studio Art Program, we honor this tradition by offering an introduction to photography using the time honored practice of photographing with film, and then processing and printing in the darkroom. This is a basic analog photographic course for people who have never held a camera much less developed their own images. Camera mechanics, exposure, understanding light, processing black and white film, and making prints are extensively covered all the while dwelling on the esthetics of the image produced as it relates to the visual world we live in today. Group critiques play a critical role in this course; students gather to evaluate and discuss the success of their accomplishments. By mid-semester and semester&#8217;s end, students produce a thematic portfolio evaluated by instructor and peer review.</p>

<p>Students will be charged a V &amp; PA lab fee upon registering for this course.<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> Offered every semester<br><br></p></div>		</td>
