<div><h3>ENG 1920 - Survey of Enviromental Writings </h3>  <hr>As concerns about climate change have become dire and widely acknowledged, environmentalism has entered the mainstream. Environmental disasters are consistently reported in the press, while questionable gadgets and products are marketed to us as as &#8216;eco-friendly.&#8217; Thi cultural concern and ambivalence about nature echoes strongly in our litereatures. Nature writers both carve out new environmental philosophies, and they can reflect existing perspectives about nature and our place within it. In <em>Environmental Writings, </em>we will read a series of texts written between the 19th and 21st centuries that address various environmental isms, and more broadly nature as a whole. These texts will include nonfiction and fiction prose, as well as poetry.<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> varies<br><br></div>		</td>
