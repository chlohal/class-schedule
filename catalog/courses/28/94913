<div><h3>PSYC 211 - Fundamentals of Applied Research through Internship </h3>  <p><hr>This is a mid-level internship course. Students will attend a weekly 3-hour seminar, and complete a placement at a local community organization. The main goal of this course is to provide you with the opportunity to apply and further develop your psychological knowledge and skills through an internship in a non-academic setting, while discussing these experiences and sharing skills with an academic community in a weekly seminar setting. The course is intended to serve as an opportunity for students to begin developing and exploring their own professional identity. This internship in applied psychology, and the community we will build in seminar, presents an opportunity for you to learn about work life from firsthand experience, to interpret workplace events and client service through a psychological perspective, and to employ students&#8217; psychological knowledge and skills toward solving practical problems and meeting the needs of your internship site.</p>
