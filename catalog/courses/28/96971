<div><h3>MCA 290 - MediaNOW! </h3>  <hr>Media Now! Theory into Practice is an interdisciplinary senior capstone course in Media Culture &amp; the Arts that provides a forum for students to synthesize knowledge gained throughout the major, and to apply what they have learned. It is a space that provides seniors the opportunity to showcase the endeavors mattering to them most - research, media production, leadership activities - and to prepare for a life in media after college. Every student will be required to plan and carry to completion a signature project in close consultation with the course instructor. For a student with a production orientation, this might be a performance, a graphic novel or an art opening. For students with an historical or analytic bent, an academic research project is another possibility. And, depending on one&#8217;s goals, the work might include a focused off-campus apprenticeship/work experience. The culmination of this course will be the planning of and participation in the MCA Graduation Symposium, an event that will provide student presenters and audience members a chance to actively engage with creative work and scholarship in all aspects: work inside and outside the classroom, in communities around Main South, and scholarly and creative pursuits in various forms.<br><br><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> MCA seniors<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> annually<br><br></div>		</td>
