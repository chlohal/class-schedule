<div><h3>MUSC 012 - Pop Music in the USA </h3>  <hr>Beginning with what is (arguably) the start of the popular in American music, this course will examine Tin Pan Alley, Blues, Country, R&amp;B, Swing, early Rock &#8216;n Roll, Motown, the Folk Revival, the British Invasion, Psychedelic Rock, Progressive Rock, Punk, Disco and Heavy Metal, as well as some more recent music. The course will focus on understanding the stylistic and historical practices of this wide range of popular music. The principle perspective of the class will address popular music as an audible text as an artifact of, and contributor to, popular music culture. No previous musical experience (such as the ability to read or play music) is assumed. However, a willingness to listen to all of this music carefully and to engage a variety of theoretical approaches is presumed.<br><br><strong>Course Designation/Attribute:</strong> AP<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> Offered periodically<br><br></div>		</td>
