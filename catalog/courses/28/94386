<div><h3>BIOL 358 - Small Scale Land Conservation in Massachusetts </h3>  <p><hr>This course is designed to introduce students to the conceptual,  ecological, and practical issues relating to small-scale land  conservation. Study sites will be within the north-central Massachusetts  region. Lectures given by the professor and local Massachusetts  conservation experts will be supplemented by numerous on-site training  activities. Students will learn: what ecological attributes of specific  sites motive small-scale conservation effords; how various groups work  together to maximize the conservation potential of small tracks of land;  how land-owners and acquiring entities come to an agreement on a  specific conservation document; and what ecological monitoring and other  similar continuing effords (e.g., control of invasive species) are  involved. Although the course will focus on the Conservation Restriction  as a conservation tool, other conservation vehicles will be explored.  Participating Massachusetts entities will include: The Trustees of  Reservations; the Massachusetts Association of Conservation  Commissioners; the North Quabbin Land Trust; and Central Massachusetts  service foresters working with the Department of Conservation &amp;  Recreation.</p>
