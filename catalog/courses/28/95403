<div><h3>IDCE 30111 - Urban Development: Process and Change </h3>  <p><hr>This graduate level course provides students with a framework for understanding the complexity of change in urban environments. The course looks at current challenges and new strategies in cities nationally and internationally, including cities experiencing disinvestment and population loss; environmental and political stress; and/or rapid expansion, among other.  The course will pursue several themes throughout:  the role of equity in urban development; the challenge of resiliency in the face of changing external forces, and the reality on the ground of local culture, governance, land, and politics that affect outcomes.  The course is open to Clark University graduate students and prospective ADP students in their senior year, who would take this as a graduate level course.  There are no prerequisites for this course.  This course is an elective in the following IDCE concentrations:  Conservation and Development; Refugees, Forced Migration, and Belonging; Youth Development; and Urban Resilience.</p>
