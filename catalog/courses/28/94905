<div><h3>ENG 111 - Creative Writing:  Nonfiction </h3>  <p><hr>True stories, well told. Creative nonfiction is like jazz-a mix of flavors, ideas, techniques. Some are new; others as old as writing itself. We are story, essay, journal article, research paper, reported journalism, memoir, even poem; personal or not, or all of the above. In this course, we will read examples and tell our own stories as well as other people&#8217;s. We&#8217;ll operate in part as a studio devoted to writing; we&#8217;ll discuss what we read and explore craft and technique. We will workshop our own work. Students submit a final publication-ready portfolio.</p>

<p>For Creative Writing minors, this course counts as one of the introductory courses.<br><br><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> VE Placement<br><br><strong>Course Designation/Attribute:</strong> N/A<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> Annually<br><br></p></div>		</td>
