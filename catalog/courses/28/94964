<div><h3>ARTH 234 - Pre-Columbian Art and Architecture </h3>  <hr>Examines how certain societies of the early Americas created objects and buildings that gave meaning to the sense of self, community and world. Objects and buildings, both in their characteristics and function, assist in the retelling of certain sociological and spiritual &#8220;truths&#8221; shared within a community. This seminar offers students an introduction to case studies of Pre-Columbian objects and architecture that reflect narratives about creation, sacrifice, divinity, and communal success. The examples are drawn from Mesoamerica (Olmec, Nayarit, Teotihuacan, Maya, and Aztec) and the Andes/Peru (Nazca, Moche, and Inca). There are no prerequisites classes in art history or language. Seminar work will include field trips to area museums and first-hand study of Pre-Columbian objects in the Worcester Art Museum.<br><br><strong>Course Designation/Attribute:</strong> DI<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> Fall<br><br></div>		</td>
