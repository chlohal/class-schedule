<div><h3>CHEM 389 - Research Methods </h3>  <p><hr>Deals with the application of analytical tools widely used in the laboratory. Topics include NMR, EPR, IR, Raman, UV-visible, mass and fluorescence spectroscopy, chromatography, electrophoresis, electrochemistry and other techniques. Emphasizes practical knowledge for data interpretation and instrument operation. Quarter-credit courses lasting four to five weeks are offered periodically. Graded as Pass/Fail.</p>

<p>May be repeatable for credit.</p>

<p><strong>Spring 2022 Topic - MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY:</strong> This course provides an introduction to the field of Medicinal Chemistry. Students will first learn the basics of the structure of a drug focusing on how it binds to its target. Next, how the body interacts/modifies the drug will be discussed including the identification of liabilities that need to be avoided/minimized which lead to the development of guidelines for drug design. Finally, three medicinal chemistry case studies will be reviewed to provide real life examples of how medicinal chemistry impacts drug discovery.</p>

<p><strong>Spring 2022 Topic - HPLC &amp; MASS SPECTROMETRY: </strong>This quarter unit course is a practical, hands-on introduction to using chromatography instruments such as high performance liquid chromatography, liquid chromatography / mass spectrometry, and gas chromatography/mass spectrometry instruments. These methods are widely used throughout both academic and industrial research settings for separating synthetic and biomolecular compounds. The course is intended for graduate students and research active undergraduates in the natural science departments.</p>

<p><strong>Fall 2021 Topic -LEEPING INTO A SCIENTIFIC CAREER:</strong> This course is intended for science students interested in learning how to successfully navigate the job market and secure a scientific job after completing their studies at Clark.  Topics to be discussed include searching for job postings, having a professional online presence, assembling an application package, how to prepare for an interview, networking, and now to approach and groom your reference letter writers.  Guest speakers from different professional scientific backgrounds will join the class to share their career paths.  Attendance and class participation are mandatory.</p>

<p><strong>Fall 2021 Topic - NMR SPECTROSCOPY:</strong> This module will focus on the principles behind the operation and data collection on NMR spectrometers. The module will review the general operating principles of the spectrometer and the key skills needed to collect data for both 1D and 2D experiments. Practical sessions will include the art of shimming, determination of pulse duration, and decoupler calibration.</p>
