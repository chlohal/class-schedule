<div><h3>MSPC 3219 - Communicating Sustainability </h3>  <hr> In this course, we will explore the theory and praxis surrounding Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) and the related attempts by organizations to respond to pressure to increase their transparency on their social, economic, and environmental impacts.  We will examine the context in which CSR emerged to include public interest beyond the obligations of regulations and legal structures and we will survey how organizations measure impacts and hold themselves accountable.  A key focus of the course will be on the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) and the adoption and evolution of its framework for sustainability reporting. <br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> Varied<br><br></div>		</td>
