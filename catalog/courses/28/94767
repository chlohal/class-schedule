<div><h3>ID 229 - Property and Community </h3>  <hr>&#8220;Property is not a thing, but a social relationship,&#8221; is this course&#8217;s point of departure. To own or possess often means to exercise power over and exclude others; however there are also ways to make land ownership more inclusive. In many areas around the world, women can neither access nor control land without permission of a man or authority figure. We will explore how development interventions to improve land access change community relations, family dynamics, and possibly influence environmental outcomes. Among the questions we will address include: How do countries reconcile traditional law and Constitutional Law introduced during colonialism?  How has the process of land grabbing changed across time? Can access to land make communities more resilient to climate change?  Course readings are global and comparative in nature, allowing us to examine land relations and policy around the world. Students are involved in setting some of the collective learning objectives and course content.  UG Capstone eligible seminar; Fulfills IDCE Conservation and Development &amp; Gender and Identity concentration.<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> varies<br><br></div>		</td>
