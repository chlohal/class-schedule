<div><h3>ASTR 001 - Exploring the Universe </h3>  <hr>Concepts, methods, and observations in astronomy, especially designed for students with little background in the sciences.  The course proceeds outward from the earth and its companion planets in the solar system to the stars and the processes that explain their brilliance in the night sky, and then onward to the galaxies and the structure of the universe as a whole.  Along the way, ideas from physics, chemistry, biology, and geology are discussed.  During the final weeks of the semester, we explore what and how scientists have learned about the history of the universe, the development of life on earth, and the likelihood of life elsewhere in the universe.  One- to two-hour evening observation sessions are a required part of the course, connecting the ideas discussed in the classroom and the textbook to the real world directly visible in the skies around us.  Not available to students who have taken Astronomy 002.  Fulfills the Scientific Perspective.<br><br><strong>Course Designation/Attribute:</strong> SP<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> Offered every fall<br><br></div>		</td>
