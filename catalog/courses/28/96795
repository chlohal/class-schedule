<div><h3>HIST 361 - Borderlands: Violence and Coexistence </h3>  <hr>A border is a line separating two sovereign entities-crossing a border means switching into a different state. At the same time, borders and borderlands are spaces of interaction. They are characterized by diversity, malleable identities, and-at times-violence. This course explores the modern history of borderland regions, including case studies in: (1) Central and East Central Europe; (2) the Middle East; (3) South Asia; and (4) the US-Mexico border. Through readings of important scholarship, literature, and film, we will consider how populations in these regions coexist, as well as the processes that transform groups in the borderlands into perpetrators and objects of intense violence.<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> Bi-annually<br><br></div>		</td>
