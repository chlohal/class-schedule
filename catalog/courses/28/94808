<div><h3>EDUC 381 - Critical Pedagogies </h3>  <hr>Critical Pedagogies frames a critique of the role of education as a means for reproducing social inequalities and presents a radical alternative of education for liberation and social change.  It seeks to bridge theory with action – enacting a social justice agenda in one&#8217;s work with others.  In this course, we will think deeply about various anti-oppressive pedagogies – critical, feminist, queer and critical race – while also practicing together our learning using these different pedagogies. We will attempt to learn by doing and modeling as much as by reading and listening.  As well, this is a course in which you will actively engage with action, working collaboratively on education projects designed for social transformation in and beyond the local community.<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> Periodically<br><br></div>		</td>
