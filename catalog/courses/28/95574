<div><h3>ID 212 - Development Management in Developing Countries: Concepts, Contexts, and Problems </h3>  <hr>In attempting to fulfill the real and perceived needs and aspirations of their people, countries in the Global South have employed (through both coercion and agency) various approaches to manage development policies. Yet such development initiatives and the processes of implementing them face enumerable structural constraints, both local and global. This upper level undergraduate and graduate seminar engages with these concerns and introduces students to the administrative and policy contexts of development in &#8220;third world&#8221; settings. Consequently, we will explore such ideas and practices as public bureaucracy, the new public management, and &#8220;good governance&#8221; in developing countries. The course also examines major conditions that developing countries encounter as they pursue &#8220;development&#8221; aspirations, including: public debt, international migration, international free/fair trade, and crime and violence. We approach these subjects primarily from the standpoint of developing states, while locating such concerns in a larger global setting.<br><br><strong>Course Designation/Attribute:</strong> GP<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> Bi-annually<br><br></div>		</td>
