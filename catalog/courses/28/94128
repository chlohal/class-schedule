<div><h3>PSYC 384 - Culture and Human Development </h3>  <hr>How do the form and function of various developmental factors and processes vary as a function of cultural context? In this course we examine the ways an individual&#8217;s psychological and social development takes place in cultural context, from infancy to adulthood. We will also examine different ways we can define and conceptualize culture. Readings include qualitative and quantitative studies of different parts of the life span in diverse cultures (globally and within the United States). While most readings are drawn from psychology, some readings are by anthropologists, legal scholars, and literary authors. Course content has implications for theoretical, research, and applied purposes. The course format is highly interactive, including discussion of readings, class exercises, films, and student presentations. Course Requirements: For developmental psychology Ph.D. students, it satisfies the developmental graduate seminar requirement. Graduate students from all other programs and departments are welcome.<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> Offered periodically<br><br></div>		</td>
