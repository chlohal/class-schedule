<div><h3>IDCE 30108 - Research Methods for Forced Migration </h3>  <p><hr>This course provides an introduction to research methods in conducting research, both qualitative and quantitative, with hidden, vulnerable, and mobile people. Introduction to main theories and research approaches on hard-to-reach, excluded, and mobile populations using different frameworks and techniques. It is designed to complement existing research design, qualitative and quantitative methods courses by providing tools to address key issues such as the lack of a known sample frame; difficulties in accessing research participants, and working with mobile networks of people across geographic space. The module explores topics such as: estimation and sampling techniques; participatory research; respondent-driven sampling (RSD), social network analysis; crowdsourcing and the use of technology in researching multi-sited populations; and ethical considerations arising when conducting research with hidden, vulnerable and mobile people.</p>
