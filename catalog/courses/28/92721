<div><h3>ARTS 137 - What & Where/Sculptural Practices </h3>  <p><hr>Sculpture course focused on contemporary issues and objects in spatial environment. We live in a material world; a world that is filled with the objects and detritus of our lives. In this studio-based sculpture class we will source the abundance of material that surrounds us. Students will explore the social, cultural and personal implications of using found and domestic objects in their work. We will discuss the multidimensional relationship between form and meaning when potentially disparate objects exist within a work. From bringing the world of objects into our work, we will then examine the possibilities of bringing our work out in to the world. What are the contextual relationships when a work is placed in a dark alleyway, on the beach, in the woods, in an old basement or on the ceiling? Does the environment in which the work exists merely inform it, or does it become a part of the work itself?</p>

<p> </p>

<p>The class will take a learning-by-doing approach, emphasizing process. Students will be taught a range of fabrication and construction methods including casting, (plaster, body, resin and plastic casting), woodworking and &#8220;soft sculpture&#8221; techniques like sewing and upholstering. In addition, we will look at examples of work, both historical and contemporary, to broaden our understanding of what sculpture is and what it can be. </p>

<p>Open to non-majors.</p>

<p>Students will be charged a V &amp; PA lab fee upon registering for this course.</p>
