<div><h3>ENT 105 - Creating a Culture of Entrepreneurship and Innovation </h3>  <hr><p style="text-align:justify;">This course explores the basic phases of entrepreneurship and innovation - identification, ideation and implementation.  Students will identify a problem, ideate solutions to the problem, and implement the solution, which will bring about change. Students will gain a greater understanding of, and appreciation for entrepreneurship and innovation by the act of doing. Entrepreneurship and innovation concepts presented in this course are supportive of intrinsically motivated issues, while helping others, the understanding of one&#8217;s own constraints and resources, and the importance of self-awareness.  This course is typically taught as a first-year intensive for incoming students in the fall semester, and for ENT elective credit in the spring.  This course can be used as an elective course as found in <em>Exploring Entrepreneurship (electives)</em>. It is also approved for a Values Perspective (VP) in support of the program of liberal studies requirements.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">This course is for first and second year students only.<br><br><strong>Course Designation/Attribute:</strong> VP<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> Every semster<br><br></div>		</td>
