<div><h3>MPA 3313 - Praxis </h3>  <hr>Renowned critical pedagogue, Paulo Freire, describes praxis as &#8220;reflection and action upon the world in order to transform it.&#8221;  For Freire, it represents an on-going cycle of collectively theorizing the world and then acting to create change based on that theorizing. In the capstone module, students will integrate what they learned from the previous modules (1,2,3), to propose a &#8220;change project&#8221; in their professional contexts. The &#8220;change&#8221; project is intended to make your context more equitable, diverse, and inclusive. By the end of the course, students will be able to know/do the following:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Translate their theories of social inequality, and their theories of social change and equity into an actionable proposal/project. </li>
	<li>Identify the levers and stakeholders within their institution/professional context. </li>
	<li>Enact a change proposal and document the effectiveness of the action. </li>
	<li>Utilize assessment techniques to evaluate effectiveness of the change action.</li>
