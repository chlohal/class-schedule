<div><h3>IDCE 395 - Culture, Environment, and Development </h3>  <p><hr><span style="font-family:verdana;font-size:8.5pt;">This course/seminar explores a wide variety of themes at the intersection of culture, development and contemporary environmental problems. The course/seminar is built on two key premises: first, humans are part of nature as each society exists within the natural world, and second, environmental problems are social problems as they concern human relations with the natural world and the politics of resource access, use and control. We investigate these issues through an examination of infrastructure development, resilience, and agricultural knowledge and technology innovation. Students are involved in setting some of our collective learning objectives and learning assessment tools.<span>Â  </span>UG Capstone eligible seminar; fulfills </span></p>
