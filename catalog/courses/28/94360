<div><h3>ENG 381 - Special Topics in 19th-C American Literature </h3>  <p><hr>Special topics in 19th-century literature through the Civil War invite in-depth consideration of how extraordinary cultural, political, and technological changes made this one of the most vibrant and studied periods of the American literature.</p>

<p><strong>F&#8217;21 Special Topic: 19<sup>th</sup> C Utopian Literature</strong></p>

<p>Utopian literature is, inherently, a social and political critique. It embodies an idealistic outlook but also a profound dissatisfaction with the status quo. Through utopian fiction, authors attempt to imagine cultural perfection, thereby expressing what they believe to be both right and wrong within their present-day surroundings. This course will focus on the intersections of utopian literature and history in the nineteenth century in the United States with an emphasis on fiction but a grounding in fact. Students will read a wide variety of utopian literature while also examining real-life utopian experiments in 1800s America along with related events in American history. The course will also engage with utopian fiction&#8217;s transnational roots and influences. Students will also study what is lacking in some utopian expressions along with the results of both realized and unrealized utopian hopes.  </p>
