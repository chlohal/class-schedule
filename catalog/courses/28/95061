<div><h3>EDUC 153 - Participatory (Action) Research with Youth </h3>  <hr>EDUC 153 focuses on what it means to research with (rather than on) youth.Â  Course participants will become familiar with what youth participatory (action) research is, and how it differs from other qualitative research traditions. Participants will try on the tools of research, such as observing/taking fieldnotes and interviewing, and explore ways of analyzing and representing data, taking into account issues around ethics, power, and the responsibilities of representation. Course participants will collaborate with youth in the community to design, carry out, and present to the public a participatory or participatory action research project.<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> Fall or Spring<br><br></div>		</td>
