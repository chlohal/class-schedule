<div><h3>MUSC 102 - Music of the Classical and Romantic Periods </h3>  <hr>This course explores music from the mid-18th century through the end of the 19th century. This era is often considered a high point in the history of musical art, and for good reason:  a great deal of extraordinary music originated at that time. Music also served as a crucially important cultural venue for the negotiation of evolving social values and tensions. Through a mix of listening, reading, discussion, and written work, students will develop an understanding of representative works from this time and of music&#8217;s social and cultural roles, as well as sharpen their appreciation of this music.  Special emphasis is placed on issues of social identity, gender, and critical reception, as well on the aesthetic power of music.  Previous musical experience is helpful, but not required.<br><br><strong>Course Designation/Attribute:</strong> AP<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> Offered every year<br><br></div>		</td>
