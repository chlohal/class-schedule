<div><h3>PSCI 286 - Advanced Topics in Comparative Politics - Capstone Seminar </h3>  <p><hr>Focus changes each year depending on faculty interest.<br>
Open to Juniors and seniors. Can be taken twice.</p>

<p><br>
FALL 2021 Topic: SOCIAL MOVEMENTS AND CONTENTIOUS POLITICS: FROM THE FRENCH REVOLUTION TO BLACK LIVES MATTER.<br>
CAPSTONE - This seminar explores the politics of contention and political struggle from the theoretical lens of the social movement literature. Students will learn how to assess attempts at collective action by examining the origins, dynamics, and results of contention as well as the range of state responses to political challenges. By the end of the course, students will be able to analyze forms of contention, tactics, framing, mobilizing structures, and outcomes for a variety of recent social movements, including Black Lives Matter. We will also focus on the role of media and technology as tools for communication, organization, and repression.<br>
