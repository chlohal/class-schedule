<div><h3>ENG 1930 - Rumplestiltskin to Ravenclaw: Children&#8217;s Literature From Golden Age to Silver Screen </h3>  <hr><span style="color:#000000;font-family:arial, sans-serif;">This course will survey the history of children&#8217;s literature from the 1800&#8217;s to the early 2000&#8217;s. Addressing works by such authors as Lewis Carroll, Roald Dahl, and J. K. Rowling, we will examine how society&#8217;s conception of childhood has changed over the past two hundred years. Supplementing our primary texts with contemporary work in the relatively new field of childhood studies, this course will also explore what children&#8217;s fiction has to tell us about cultural values and institutions. Among other things, we&#8217;ll consider the role children&#8217;s literature has played (and continues to play) in the culture of imperialism and the construction of gender and sexuality, and its increasing commercialization via film series and franchises. </span><br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> Varies<br><br></div>		</td>
