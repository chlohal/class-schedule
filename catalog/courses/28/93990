Focusing on a number of key issue-areas this course investigates the origins and development of international law; particularly, it seeks to examine how international law influences the subjectivities, competences and responsibilities of the participant member states, and their consequent impact on state sovereignty, use of force, humanitarian intervention, international criminal tribunals, and other transnational legal mechanisms. The overall purpose of this course is to introduce and lay the foundation for an informed analysis on the limits and possibilities of international law in world affairs.<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> Offered every other year.<br><br></div>		</td>
