<div><h3>MGMT 5783 - Global Business Seminar </h3>  <p><hr>This intensive course combines readings and discussion at Clark University with a week of traveling in a foreign country with visits to foreign (in most cases U.S.) and national firms. Current global business events are examined in light of management theories as well as the country&#8217;s economic and political policies and its social, cultural, and historical context. Seven class sessions are held on campus, followed by a week of visits to companies in the country visited. Details about trip location (changes each year), travel dates, and additional expenses associated with this course will be shared prior to the semester start.</p>

<p>Counts as Experiential Learning Requirement II for the MBA and MSF program or as an elective.</p>

<p> <br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> Only offered in the Spring semester.<br><br></p></div>		</td>
