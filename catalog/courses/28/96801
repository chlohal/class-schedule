<div><h3>CYES 112 - Transformatiive Schooling </h3>  <hr>This is a field-based and inquiry-oriented seminar, an apprenticeship in documentary filmmaking as well as in school and community research and advocacy for social change. The course involves instruction in the basics of video production (using state of the art digital cameras) and seminar members partner with new and experienced teachers in inner city public schools. We work with them as video assistants and also develop our own films about the challenges and possibilities of urban school reform. In addition to &#8220;hands-on&#8221; activity, there is serious attention to reading in the field of ethnographic research, education reform, and community institutions that support youth development. Moreover, seminar members get involved in grass roots organizing and soliciting input from the community, as well as ongoing critique of their planning documents, their filmed footage, and their written companion texts. We thus integrate fieldwork with theory and reflective critique. A final project for this seminar will be completed in the spring semester. Fulfills the values perspective and is recommended for all Communication and Culture majors.
