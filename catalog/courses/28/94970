<div><h3>PSYC 367 - Narrative and Friendship </h3>  <hr>Employing a capstone-format, this course examines the use of narrative as an increasingly influential and integrating paradigm within psychology, the social sciences, and the humanities. Our topic this semester will be the conceptual foundations of the narrative perspective including methods of analysis, and their application to the theme of <em>Friendship</em>. The participants will be given the opportunity to explore &#8216;Friendship&#8217; in the form of a group project from a perspective of their own choosing, in which narrative serves as a basic analytic and organizing principle.<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> Annually<br><br></div>		</td>
