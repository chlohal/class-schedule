<div><h3>PHIL 1340 - Philosophy and Politics </h3>  <hr>Politicians like to reference political theories (Locke&#8217;s or Mill&#8217;s, or the Australian economists&#8217;, e.g.) to frame their vision and they label their opponents (as socialists, liberals, etc.). We will look beyond the labels and discuss these theories themselves. We will consider a wide range of historical and contemporary political theories that attempt to answer these and similar questions: What is the most ideal form of government? What obligations, fundamental rights and liberties do we have? Should wealth be distributed over the members of the society or should property right be sacred and unquestionable? This course is designed to help you form your own political views and understand their historical roots and the arguments for and against them.<br><br><strong>Course Designation/Attribute:</strong> VP (summer only)<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> varies<br><br></div>		</td>
