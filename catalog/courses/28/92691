<div><h3>ARTH 158 - Art and the City of Worcester </h3>  <hr>This class is an introduction to art history, using the rich trove of art collections within the city of Worcester as primary objects of study. Each week we will be immersed in the art of a specific time and place, reading relevant articles and then examining, in person, actual examples of art from the period. Over the course of the semester, we will visit the collections of the Worcester Art Museum, the American Antiquarian Society, and the Higgins Armory Museum, and will also study several examples of public art in the city. By the end of the semester, students will have gained a foundation in art history and will also have come to know the City of Worcester in greater depth. Fulfills the Aesthetic Perspective requirement.<br><br><strong>Course Designation/Attribute:</strong> AP<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> Offered periodically<br><br></div>		</td>
