<div><h3>ART 2120 - Drawing Extended-Works On Paper </h3>  <hr>Concentrating on more expressive use of drawing materials we will work with both observation and imagination with consideration of composition and scale. More complex objects will be drawn from and include the use of color and wet media. Standard drawing materials will be augmented with the inclusion of collage, montage, monotype and &#8220;accidental&#8221; effects&#8221;. Demonstrations and discussions of artists&#8217; works will expand our approach to drawing in expressing our dreams and visions. Previous drawing experience is necessary. Students will be responsible for purchasing their own supplies.<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> varies<br><br></div>		</td>
