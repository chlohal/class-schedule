<p><strong>MSPC 3440-01 International Advertising and Marketing  </strong>The course introduces students to challenges, complexities and opportunities involved in developing marketing strategies and implementing communication plans for international markets. It highlights importance of culture and media technology in understanding the way consumers interact with brands and respond to brand messages across platforms, devices, and in different media. The course draws upon key theories and models of culture, as well as cross-cultural studies described in academic papers to help future professionals interpret advertising messages and make educated decisions regarding advertising strategy, its execution, media planning, and evaluation in international markets. It also equips students with research methods, platforms, and tools (Qualtrics, Amazon MTurk, JASP, etc.) that provide guidance in developing and conducting their own original studies. As an outcome of the course, students will be offered to design a study proposal exploring consumers&#8217; responses to brand messages in social media across cultures, incorporating theory and method taught in the class.</p>
