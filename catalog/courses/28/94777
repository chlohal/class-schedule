<div><h3>ARTH 156 - African Art and Architecture </h3>  <hr>This introductory course focuses in the art and architecture of the vast African  continent from prehistory to the present day, including the art of the global  African <i>diaspora</i>. It addresses the wide range of African arts from the  many diverse African peoples and regions and the complex historical, cultural  and religious overlay with the introduction of Judaism, Christianity and Islam  and colonial rule. Particular aspects of African art featured will include  visual abstraction, innovation of form and assemblage of materials, the primacy  of sculpture and adornment of the human body, and the linkage of art to ritual  and performance. Students will also critically evaluate problematic and  discrepant interpretations of African art and changing perceptions. This course  operates on the theory that &#8220;less is more&#8221; and we will focus on a few select  monuments from each area and period of Africa to study in depth.<br><br><strong>Course Designation/Attribute:</strong> AP<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> Periodically<br><br></div>		</td>
