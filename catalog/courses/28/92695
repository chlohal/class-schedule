<div><h3>ARTH 216 - Architecture and Democracy </h3>  <hr>This seminar explores the relationship between the built environment and civic ideology in ancient Athens and 20th-century America. &#8220;Built environment&#8221; refers to structures in, through and around which a society functions and includes both private and public buildings and spaces. &#8220;Civic ideology&#8221; means ideas that embody the collective beliefs and aspirations of the citizen body. In particular we will be interested in the relationship between the individual citizen and the state in ancient Athens and 20th-century United States and the means by which architecture acts to construct that relationship. Area field trips.<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> Offered every other year<br><br></div>		</td>
