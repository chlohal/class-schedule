<div><h3>GEOG 196 - Development and Environment in Latin America: Difficult Questions, Creative Responses </h3>  <hr>This first-year intensive, run as a seminar, will ask students to consider deeply difficult questions about the relationships between economic development, human rights, cultural difference and the environment. We address these dilemmas for the case of Latin America, and will interact with professionals and activists primarily from Latin America who work on these issues every day and seek to develop creative responses. The course will focus on the complex relationships among natural resource extraction, large-scale agriculture, large-scale infrastructure, community-based development, and human and indigenous peoples&#8217; rights. As such, the seminar also introduces students to on-going research being conducted at Clark University and in which they may later wish to become involved.<br><br><strong>Course Designation/Attribute:</strong> VP<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> Bi-anually<br><br></div>		</td>
