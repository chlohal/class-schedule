<p>Baseball has often been cited as &#8220;America&#8217;s game,&#8221; in the sense that it is thoroughly interwoven into the history of American culture. Many writers, particularly in the 20<sup>th</sup> century, have seen in the game fertile ground for describing their interpretations of the American experience. It is a game which offers tremendous variety within rigidly set boundaries. In short, baseball is a metaphor to which Americans return repeatedly to express their sense of identity. It is this general theme that this course will explore: why is baseball so attractive to American writers of all types, and how do they use the game and its players as the basis for suggesting who we are?
