<div><h3>PSYC 386 - Advanced Topics in Developmental Psychology </h3>  <p><hr>This capstone seminar provides students the opportunity to consider how to link theory and research in developmental psychology to authentic problems and issues. Students will be involved in a project working with a local organization, as well as have the opportunity to link the study of human development to areas of personal interest.</p>

<p><strong>FALL 2020</strong>: <strong>College-Going Emerging Adults</strong>.This course focuses on understanding the development of young adults who are of college-going age (ages 18-29 years).  We will consider how a young person develops with and within many developmental contexts; how these contexts both shape and are shaped by the young person&#8217;s experiences within them.  We will explore topics such as the role that relationships play in development, in particular how they might shape a young person&#8217;s school and career pathways.  We will also explore topics sparked by students interaction with the assigned readings, and their exploration of rich qualitative and quantitative data collected with young adults taking varying developmental paths. The course takes a relational approach to understanding the different facets of emerging adult development by examining the many factors that might contribute to their developmental experiences.  Classes will feature opportunities for rich discussion, thought provoking activities, and a few guests from community based organizations and other scholars in the field.</p>
