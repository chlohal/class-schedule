<div><h3>HIST 205 - The Reformation:  Violence and Reform in the Sixteenth Century </h3>  <hr>By focusing on both theology and social history, this course details the main features of the Protestant and Catholic Reformations that swept across Europe in the sixteenth century. Questioning received wisdom, the doctrines of Luther, Zwingli, and Calvin provided the foundation for a new relationship between the individual believer and God in areas that became Protestant. Unintentionally, the doctrines also spawned radical social movements that threatened the status quo. The Catholic Reformation led to the acceptance of the Bible as a source of truth, the establishment of seminaries to train priests, and the confirmation of the Pope as the head of the Church.<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> Offered every other year<br><br></div>		</td>
