<div><h3>SOC 205 - Sociology of the Environment </h3>  <hr>This course provides an overview of key issues and foundational perspectives in environmental sociology, while also drawing on science and technology studies (STS) and gender studies. We will build toward a critical understanding of the systemic causes and inequitable consequences of environmental disruption. Key topics will include the sociology of climate change, racism and the environment, food systems and inequality, the sociology of environmental health, and technological disasters. We will also reflect on paradigms of scientific inquiry as they relate to environmental controversies, with a particular focus on political and scientific disputes regarding the environmental causes of human health problems. Finally, we will also explore the history of social responses to such controversies, most notably the environmental justice movement and environmental health movement, with an eye to considering solutions that are socially just.<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> offered periodically<br><br></div>		</td>
