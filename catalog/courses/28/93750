<div><h3>MGMT 4709 - Business in Society </h3>  <p><hr>This course examines the inextricable relationship between the 3 sectors of any economy - the business sector, the public sector,  and the citizen sector - and how each affects the other in today&#8217;s global economy.  In a world that has become increasingly interdependent, the relationship between business and society has become ever more complex.  A thematic question raised throughout the course is, <strong><em>&#8221; Does business have a social responsibility ?&#8221; </em></strong> to the communities in which it operates beyond that of making a profit .  Students will examine their own values and ethical perspectives and how personal values/ethics inform business decisions.  Case studies, outside reading, contemporary events, and personal experiences will inform the basis of much of the class discussion.</p>
