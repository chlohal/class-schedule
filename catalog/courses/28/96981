<div><h3>MSCS 3055 - Design and Analysis of Algorithms </h3>  <hr>This course will provide an exploration of the design and analysis of algorithms. It covers advanced data structures and algorithms, along with design techniques such as divide-and-conquer, dynamic programming, greedy algorithms, and search techniques. It also covers basic algorithm analysis including running time and memory space analysis, as well as ideas such as NP-Completeness. Additional topics may include randomized algorithms and approximation algorithms.<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> Annually<br><br></div>		</td>
