<div><h3>HIST 133 - Women during the Holocaust </h3>  <hr>The aim of this introductory level course is to familiarize students with the history of the Holocaust by analyzing the experiences of women.  Women are often viewed as the objects of history - things happen to them; they don&#8217;t make things happen.  Certainly, the application of Nazi policy, derived and carried out primarily by men inside Germany and throughout occupied Europe, falls into this category.  Nazi policy affected various groups of women in diverse ways.  But always, women crafted their lives in response to Nazi policy:  some embraced it, others rejected it outright, and many did whatever they could just to get by.  In this course, students will analyze women&#8217;s agency within varying degrees of constraint and why women&#8217;s experiences are important.  Students will read a variety of texts that explore the experiences of women as victims, perpetrators, rescuers and resisters.  Lecture/Discussion<br><br><strong>Course Designation/Attribute:</strong> HP<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> Bi-annually Fall and/or Spring<br><br></div>		</td>
