<div><h3>GEOG 369 - Relational Political-Economic Geographies </h3>  <hr>Relationality - the notion that the world is constituted and transformed by contingent, dynamic, and embedded relationships between people, places, objects, and structures - has emerged as a key concept in human geography. This course interrogates critically the idea of relationality and assesses its significance and possibilities for contemporary thinking in economic and development geography. Participants will read, critique, discuss, and debate a variety of theories about and sub-disciplinary perspectives on relational thinking - from economic sociology, organizational studies, critical realism, phenomenology, actor-network theory, Marxism, feminism, urban-economic geography, and development studies - and evaluate how these works might inform our understandings of contemporary political-economic issues. For doctoral students only.<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> annually<br><br></div>		</td>
