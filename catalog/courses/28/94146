<div><h3>SCRN 130 - Film Genre </h3>  <p><hr>Devoted to the study of the major storytelling formats into which much narrative filmmaking (especially that of the American cinema) may be categorized. The course considers theoretical perspectives, formal description, historical background and social implications of genres such as the western, gangster film, musical, melodrama, etc., and through this work enables students to engage in and experience the interpretive insights of this critical perspective on the cinema. This course is taught as a variable topic, and may be offered as either an overview of several film genres or as a course concentrating on intensive study of a particular genre.</p>

<p><em>May be repeated for credit. </em></p>

<p><em>Spring 2022 Topic: Horror</em></p>

<p><em>This course explores the horror genre as it has evolved from its earliest beginnings in the silent era, to its present-day iterations in film, television, and other media.  Throughout the semester, we&#8217;ll be considering topics including, but not limited to, the nature and aesthetics of horror; audience reception; standards of value and taste; and representations of race, gender, sexuality, and class.  Students will therefore develop a stronger understanding of the importance and value of the horror genre, in its national and international contexts. </em></p>
