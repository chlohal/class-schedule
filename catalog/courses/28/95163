<p>This is an enhanced internship experience for students interested in the curation and presentation of four art exhibitions in the Schitlkamp Gallery and several shows in the Art Lab in the Traina Center for the Arts.  Students will work on all aspects of planning and preparing for shows and related programming in the main gallery space, as well as curating and organizing shows of their own design in the Art Lab and possibly other spaces on campus.  The internship/course will also involve visiting outside exhibitions and discussing how the context of displaying art and artifacts can affect how they are perceived.  How is art chosen to be displayed, who chooses, how and where is the art presented and how does this determine discourse about it?  This course will continue throughout the year and students are encouraged to enroll both semesters, though this is not a requirement. <br><br><strong>Course Designation/Attribute:</strong> POP<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> periodically<br><br></p></div>		</td>
