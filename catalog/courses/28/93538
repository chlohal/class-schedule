<p><strong>Spring 2019 topic: DISPLACEMENT AND REPRESENTATION: ART, ADVOCACY, AND PUBLIC EDUCATION</strong></p>

<p>The movement of people is depicted in many forms and for many purposes. Often used to inform or influence, the stories and portrayals of displaced people have become common topics in everything from news broadcasts and documentaries to museum exhibits, social protest art, and avant-garde performances. Moreover, art and visual mediums produced by displaced people have become important means of countering stereotypes, supporting humanitarian projects, aiding community formation and providing therapeutic expression for individuals.</p>

<p>In this class we will focus on the representation of displaced people and visualization of displacement more generally in a variety of creative and informative formats. We will take a broad view of displacement comparing and contrasting the experiences forced migration, homelessness, refugeeism, and restrictive immigration processes. We will pair these experiences with particular visual forms: documentary film, ethnographic photography, protest performance art, and therapeutic graphic arts. Students will engage with theory and case studies as well as produce their own visual project centered on representing the experiences of displaced people.</p>
