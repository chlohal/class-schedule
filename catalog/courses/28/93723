<div><h3>BCOM 170 - Managerial Communications </h3>  <p><hr>Strong communicative abilities are essential to career success and are particularly important to managers who must direct employees to perform work. People with highly developed communication skills become more persuasive and are better leaders. This course examines communication strategy which includes audience analysis, channel decisions, intercultural communication, diversity, ethics, and more. Communication as used by individuals and organizations are examined. Students will practice all facets of the communication process - from logic and organizing thoughts to conducting research and analyzing/presenting data and other information in both written and verbal form. Learning by doing is an essential part of the course and students will experience in-class exercises, class discussions, conducting research and examining sources, working independently and as part of a team, researching new and innovated companies, delivering impactful written/verbal presentations, and delivering an impromptu speaking exercise under less than ideal circumstances. Students will be introduced to and are expected to use a variety of industry &#8220;best practices.&#8221;</p>
