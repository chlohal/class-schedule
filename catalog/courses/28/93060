<div><h3>ENG 110 - Lyric Architectures:  Reading Poetry </h3>  <p><hr>This course will help you to become a better close reader of modern poetry and introduce you to a selection of British poets. We will read poetry and essays by major poets of the British canon, including Blake, Wordsworth, Coleridge, Shelley, Keats, Tennyson, Browning, Christina Rossetti, Yeats, Eliot, Larkin, and Heaney. We will also read selections from recent poets who experiment with poetic form and interrogate conventional understandings of British national identity, including work by Wole Soyinka, Louise Bennett, Eavan Boland, and Thom Gunn. Our central aims will be to enhance your comprehension of poetic form and to investigate connections between poetry, politics, and culture. Strongly recommended for English majors in the first or second year; seniors by permission. For undergraduate English majors and minors, this course satisfies the Genre (C-1) requirement.</p>
