<div><h3>ART 1500 - Landscape Up Close: A Study of Natural Form </h3>  <hr><span style="color:rgb(0,0,0);font-family:helvetica;">The focus of this course is to expand our observational powers and our conceptual abilities through drawing from organic forms such as rocks, roots, bones, vegetables, seashells, plants, and trees. Discussion of visual qualities found in the forms such as shape, line, surface texture and three-dimensional structure will expand your drawing concepts and abilities through the use of conte, ink, and pencil, alone and in combination. Additional media such as collage, off-press printmaking and relief will be included to expand your drawing vobcabulary. Works by artists such as Van Gogh, Mondrian, Ellsworth Kelly, Jean Dubuffet, Jennifer Bartlett, Sylvia Plimack Mangold and Joseph Stella will be studied. Some previous drawing experience helpful.</span><br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> varies<br><br></div>		</td>
