<div><h3>PSCI 161 - Women, Politics and Public Policy </h3>  <p><hr>How has the importance of gender in politics changed over time? Must women represent women? Can men also represent women? Do women and men participate politically in different ways? Why is there a persistent gender gap in political leadership? Do women campaign differently than men? Do women govern differently than men? What are &#8220;women&#8217;s issues&#8221;? Do they affect all women equally? This course explores these and other questions, drawing on a range of literature from political science and public policy as well as non-academic news sources. We will also investigate varying ways in which the categories of gender, race and ethnicity, and other politically-relevant categories intersect. Finally, we will analyze how a range of public policies may affect men and women differently, focusing specifically on contemporary policy debates.</p>
