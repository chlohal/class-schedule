<div><h3>SCRN 219 - Advanced Production Topics </h3>  <p><hr>This rotating-topics course engages students in various subfield-specific production topics, with instruction by professionals in each area. Semester-long course topics will include: cinematography, editing, and experimental filmmaking. Spring 2021 topics are Experimental Film or Cinematography.</p>

<p>The topic for Spring 2022 is FIRST-PERSON FILMMAING. Each student will conceptualize and create a short (8-12 minute) film that utilizes to some extent the first-person point of view. First-person filmmaking needn&#8217;t be nonfiction or autobiographical. Instead, through relevant writing, screening and readings, students will be encouraged to rethink and transcend genre conventions and make films that will be ready to submit to festivals by the end of the semester. Student projects may include but not necessarily be limited to Docudrama, Essay Film, First-Person Documentary, Hybrid Film, Pseudo-Documentary, and Mockumentary. Students will be charged a V &amp; PA lab fee upon registering for this course.  </p>
