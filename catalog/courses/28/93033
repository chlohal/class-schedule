<div><h3>EN 207 - Climate Change, Energy and Development </h3>  <hr>This course explores climate change, energy, development and policy using multiple perspectives, disciplines and scales. Fusing perspectives from both the natural and social sciences, this interdisciplinary course will grapple with diverse themes and issues at the intersection of environmental science and policy. Climate change related topics deal with the evolving science of climate change. Energy related themes deal with pro and cons of different forms of energy generation, including an examination of geoengineering and carbon capture and storage. Development dimensions deal with human dimensions of climate change and energy challenges and address ethical and economic perspectives, food and human security.
