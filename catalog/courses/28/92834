<div><h3>CHEM 101 - Introductory Chemistry I </h3>  <p><hr>This course is designed to meet the needs of science majors with an interest in chemistry, biochemistry, biology, or environmental science and students with an interest in the health professions. It will introduce students to fundamental chemical concepts dealing with the structure, bonding, and reactivity of molecules. Major topics include thermochemistry, ideal gas theory, chemical periodicity, and bonding and geometry of molecules. The laboratory sections introduce students to the techniques of chemical experimentation and the methods of chemical analysis needed for chemistry and other sciences. Knowledge of high-school algebra is necessary; high-school chemistry and physics are helpful, but not required.  Registration  includes a pre-lecture meeting time one day a week.  <br>
Must register for one laboratory section.</p>
