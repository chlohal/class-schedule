<div><h3>HIST 290 - Honors Forum </h3>  <p><hr>The Honors Forum is a class designed to support honors students as they go through the process of writing their honors theses. It meets every other week and is intended to be a two-course sequence, each semester worth ¼ credit. Support consists of developing skills specific to writing history at an advanced undergraduate level. These include but are not limited to: time management for a year-long project, developing a research question,finding primary and second sources, managing the ups and downs of the research process, putting together an historiography, working with bibliographic management software, and crafting strong prose. Support also includes presenting one&#8217;s own work and providing constructive those of others.This class is meant to support, not supplant, the work honors students do with their advisors. <em>Must be taken with HIST 297.</em></p>
