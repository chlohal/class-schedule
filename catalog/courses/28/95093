<div><h3>ART 1780 - Essentials of Modern Art </h3>  <hr>In this course we will focus on demystifying the all too often intimidating and misunderstood art of the 20th century and making it rather palatable and quite easy to approach. Beginning with an analysis of contemporary cultural trends, the course then explores the roots of these trends by turning to the Modernist period. After some training in &#8216;aesthetic scanning&#8217;, a method for looking at writing about and discussing art, students will have the opportunity to study the connections with the major artistic movements from Impressionism through Post-Modern performance, informational, word, installation, and street art.<br><br><strong>Course Designation/Attribute:</strong> AP (summer only)<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> varied<br><br></div>		</td>
