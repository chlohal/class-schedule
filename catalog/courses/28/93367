<div><h3>HIST 118 - Revolutionary Europe, 1789-1918 </h3>  <hr>This course examines the history of Europe between the French Revolution in 1789 and the end of World War I in 1918 and the destruction of European monarchies and empires. It will cover all regional parts of Europe but focus on France, England, Germany, Austria-Hungary, Italy, and Russia. Rather than following a chronological narrative, the course will explore specific topics and thus explain major political, social, economic and cultural transformations such as industrialization, urbanization, nation-building, imperialism, the eugenic movement, the rise of the working class and of socialism, the change of the gender order, and other. Each of them will cover one week, usually by providing a survey at the first weekly meeting and by discussing a related special aspect or a document at the second meeting of that week.<br><br><strong>Course Designation/Attribute:</strong> HP<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> Offered every other year<br><br></div>		</td>
