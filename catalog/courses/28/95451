<div><h3>ENG 1220 - Critical Thinking </h3>  <hr>Regardless of university major, Critical Thinking is the integral element in education. Critical Thinking deals with language, particularly the process by and through which evaluation of ideas, and their subsequent validity, is established in academic discourse. Therefore, it is both reflexive and reflective. In this course, students engage in the process of Critical Thinking and its practical application. The evaluation of ideas from multiple disciplines will be primary, as well as a focus on rhetorical argument, with an eye to habits that hinder thinking, errors affecting validity, deductive and inductive reasoning, and moral dilemmas.<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> varied<br><br></div>		</td>
