<div><h3>PHIL 2010 - The Meaning of Life </h3>  <hr>Questions about the meaning of life arise in literature, films and other art forms as well as in our own personal experience. In this course we will consider philosophical approaches to these questions. And consider what sort of question is being asked about life&#8217;s meaning and why. Are we asking questions about an individual&#8217;s own life or about human life generally? Why should we care whether human life has meaning or not? What facts about human existence raise the question in the first place? We will consider what type of answers can be given to questions about the meaning of life and will also consider whether we have a reason to regret our death, and the role of atheism, religion and morality in raising and responding to questions about the purpose of life.<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> various<br><br></div>		</td>
