<div><h3>ENG 392 - Toni Morrison </h3>  <hr>Nobel Laureate Toni Morrison forever reconfigured how the world studies literature and race. Reading her novels, poetry, and non-fiction, we will examine how Morrison&#8217;s writing enhances African American literary theory by critiquing the role race plays within the literary canon and society as a whole. Implementing Morrison&#8217;s strategies such as removing the white gaze and discovering the Africanist presence, we will explore the historical and psychological themes of race, colorism, the ancestor, motherhood, multigenerational trauma, and love. The course is discussion and inquiry-based, so students must read, participate, moderate, and challenge themselves to think critically.<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> Annually or Bi-annually<br><br></div>		</td>
