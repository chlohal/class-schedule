<div><h3>EN 177 - Health and the Urban Environment </h3>  <hr>One of the next frontiers in environmentalism is the urban environment and the ways that the social, physical, and built environments can influence human health. This course explores that frontier, looking at risks that the built environment can pose to human health; roles that science can play in assessing these risks; and challenges of that approach. We will also look at urbanization and early public health movements; current trends in globalization and urban growth; susceptible populations and disparities in urban health; the health effects of urban sprawl; social capital and other aspects of the urban environment that can be health promoting; food and the urban footprint.<br><br><strong>Course Designation/Attribute:</strong> GP<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> -<br><br></div>		</td>
