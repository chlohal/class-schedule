<div><h3>ENG 102 - From Cli-Fi to Frankenstein: Reading and Writing Climate Narrative </h3>  <hr>Stories of social disruption, restructuring, and transformation have long been at the heart of literature&#8217;s ways of radically re-imagining what ails us. In this course, we explore &#8220;nature&#8221; at large and climate change specifically, as a phenomenon affecting our transformations. We will reflect, individually and collaboratively, through a series of assignments, on narratives about climate change, environmental justice and sustainability, to name a few, and their effects upon our experiences of the everyday. We will engage with fiction, scholarly essay, creative nonfiction, memoir, journalism and ecopoetics. We will write imaginatively and critically, and along the way, explore both contemporary and historical writings of race, class and ethnicities, including indigenous populations, humans, animals, nature and the sacred.Offered periodically.<br><br><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> VE Placement or IDND 018<br><br><strong>Course Designation/Attribute:</strong> VE<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> Annually<br><br></div>		</td>
