<div><h3>PSYC 1690 - Psychology of Buddhism </h3>  <hr>This course will provide and overview of Buddhist thought and its significance for psychology. The three main branches of Buddhism will be represented: the essential teachings of Theravada as its base, the rich philosophical understanding of the nature of reality (Mahayana) and the esoteric tantric vehicle ( Vajrayana) made accessible to Westerners today by virtue of the Tibetan diaspora. We will study this encompassing and comprehensive system for what it tells about the nature of the person, mind, and reality in relation to our understanding of human psychology. In addition, we will explicitly consider the relationship to Western psychology in praxis and theory.<br><br><strong>Course Designation/Attribute:</strong> VP (summer only)<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> varies<br><br></div>		</td>
