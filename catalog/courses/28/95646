<div><h3>EN 267 - Climate Change Adaptation </h3>  <hr>As atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases continue to increase, humans must adapt to changing conditions and new extremes. Adaptation efforts are integral to addressing climate change and its impacts on people. Although the notion of adaptation might seem simple and clear, efforts to implement adaptation projects have raised important questions about the extent to which adaptation is possible. Furthermore, what it means to adapt to a changing climate depends greatly on who and where you are, which exacerbates the inequity of impacts. In this seminar-style course, students will investigate the concept of adaptation, its evolution in academic literature and climate policy, and its implications for agriculture, water resources, biodiversity, and gender relations. In addition, we will explore limits to adaptation, risk of maladaptation, and measures of adaptive capacity.<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> Annually<br><br></div>		</td>
