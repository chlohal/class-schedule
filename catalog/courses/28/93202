<div><h3>FREN 249 - The French-Speaking World In the 21st Century </h3>  <hr>An interdisciplinary analysis of the effects of globalization in French-speaking countries around the world. Through literature, social texts, and fiction film and documentaries we explore such issues as the rise of religious extremism; the Algerian  civil war;  the problematic role of French language and culture in former French colonies decades after independence; the social, economic  and cultural consequences of globalization; the intersection between the local and the global; migration patterns from or within the francophone world; and other contemporary issues which the postcolonial francophone world is facing.<br>
