<div><h3>MPA 3117 - Comparative Public Adminstration </h3>  <hr>Students will learn the differences among countries in administrative structure, in personnel recruitment and management, the politics of the bureaucracy, and administrative accountability.  Students will be able to analyze the role of the international political economy in public administration as well as how local governments create collaboration between the public and private sector, and non-governmental organizations in policy implementation. Finally, students will learn professionalism and ethics.  This introductory class will contain an ethics component dealing with cultural differences between universalist and particularist legal systems, and individual and collective ethical cultures.  Deliverables include a final paper analyzing the state and local administration of a specific country chosen by the student, perhaps the home country of an international student.  <br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> Varied<br><br></div>		</td>
