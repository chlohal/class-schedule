<div><h3>IDCE 30240 - Community Development Planning Studio </h3>  <p><hr>This graduate level course tackles projects in real world situations related to community development and planning.  In a studio, a team of students and the instructor collaborate on a common problem, working individually and as a group to address distinct dimensions of the task at hand. Projects are often defined by client organization(s) and address current and relevant topics in urban situations. The work products are designed to be informative to local organizations, residents, and the city.  The Clark Community Development and Planning Studio actively pursues an equity agenda.  By taking this studio, students gain experience in project-based learning; project management skills; research skills; practical knowledge of current issues and challenges; and balancing multiple interests and trade-offs in charting the future.  The course is open to Clark University graduate students and prospective ADP students in their senior year, who would take this as a graduate level course.  There are no prerequisites for this course.  This is a core course in the Community Development and Planning (CDP) program and also serves as an elective in the Urban Resilience concentration. </p>
