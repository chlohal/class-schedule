<div><h3>IDCE 30391 - Introduction to Public Policy: Context and Analysis </h3>  <hr>Nonprofit and public affairs professionals are faced with finding viable solutions to increasingly complex public problems-from raising revenue to fix congested roadways to reducing poverty. To do so they often rely on policy analysts to investigate problems, formulate solutions, forecast outcomes, and choose between competing policy proposals. This course introduces students to the major institutions and processes involved in the development and implementation of public policy in the United States. We will examine why some problems reach the public agenda, why some solutions are adopted and others rejected, and why some policies appear to succeed while others appear to fail. The course will also explore a number of contemporary issues in American public policy that can impact the work of nonprofit and public affairs professionals such as education, health, social welfare, immigration, and the environment.<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> Annually (Module)<br><br></div>		</td>
