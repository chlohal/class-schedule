<div><h3>PSCI 288 - Immigration, Identity, and Diversity Politics in the US </h3>  <hr>Today, one in ten residents of the U.S. was born outside the United States.  Yet, debates over immigration continue to permeate American life, from attempts to ban Muslim immigrants from entering the U.S. to questions about the status of undocumented immigrants to state and local proposals that would limit immigrants&#8217; rights.  This course addresses these and many other issues, exploring the political and historical roots of contemporary US immigration policy as well as how immigration and immigrant groups have changed over time. We will also examine the integration of immigrants into the U.S., including the ways in which different groups are distinctive in their political attitudes and behaviors.  Additionally, we will study the varying ways in which immigrant communities and immigration policy continue to influence political debate in the U.S.<br><br><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> <a href="preview_course_nopop.php?catoid=26&coid=86593" onclick="acalogPopup('preview_course.php?catoid=26&coid=86593&print', '3', 770, 530, 'yes');return false;" rel="remote /ajax/preview_course.php?catoid=26&coid=86593&display_options[location]=tooltip&show" id="tt7547" target="_blank">PSCI 050</a><span style="display: none !important">&#160;</span> <br><br><strong>Course Designation/Attribute:</strong> DI<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> Bi-annually<br><br><div style="display: none; z-index: 1000;" class="tooltip for_tt7547"></div></div>		</td>
