<div><h3>CJ 1980 - Technologies in Criminal justice </h3>  <hr>Could modern technology have solved or possibly even prevented some of the most notorious crimes of the past century? Are modern day social networking sites such as facebook, myspace and twitter creating new more easily accessible victims such as those involved in the alleged &#8220;Craigslist killings&#8221; or are they an invaluable tool to law enforcement officials in the tracking and subsequent arrests of these predators?<br>
Throughout this course we will examine the application of developing technologies in the field of criminal justice. Students learn forensic science techniques, computer applications for disasters and emergencies, record management systems, crime mapping, and automated fingerprint identification systems. The course also covers computerized booking systems, integrated criminal justice information systems, less than lethal weapons, and &#8220;interoperable&#8221; wireless communications. Students explore the relationships of these new technologies and how they influence changes in criminal justice agency policy and procedure. The impact of social networking sites will also be explored in depth.<br><br><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> <a href="preview_course_nopop.php?catoid=26&coid=87320" onclick="acalogPopup('preview_course.php?catoid=26&coid=87320&print', '3', 770, 530, 'yes');return false;" rel="remote /ajax/preview_course.php?catoid=26&coid=87320&display_options[location]=tooltip&show" id="tt4125" target="_blank">ENG 1000</a><span style="display: none !important">&#160;</span>Â or equivalent<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> n/a<br><br><div style="display: none; z-index: 1000;" class="tooltip for_tt4125"></div></div>		</td>
