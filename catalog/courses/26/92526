<div><h3>IDCE 30341 - HEALTH PROMOTION AND INTERVENTIONS </h3>  <hr>This course will examine a number of key theories used in health promotion globally (e.g., health belief, stages of change, PRECEDE-PROCEED and social-ecological models, among others). We will draw on real-world examples to explore the strengths and weaknesses of these various approaches. Students will examine detailed case studies of specific health &#8220;interventions&#8221;, and will explore why some interventions succeed and others fail. Case studies will largely be drawn from the Global South and will focus, among others, on infectious disease control programs (e.g., TB, malaria), reproductive health (e.g., maternal health), sexual health (e.g., sexually transmitted infections) and child health (e.g., immunization campaigns). The course will discuss these issues from a multi-disciplinary lens that encompasses anthropological, feminist, global health and public health perspectives.<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> Annually<br><br></div>		</td>
