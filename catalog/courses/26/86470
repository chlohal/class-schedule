<div><h3>MUSC 100 - Studying Music Historically and Critically </h3>  <hr>This course is designed to introduce music majors and minors to the historical and critical study of music. The course is required for all music majors and minors and is a prerequisite for other more specialized music history courses. The course surveys major style periods of Western music (Renaissance, Baroque, Classical, Romantic, and Modern). Along the way, you will develop the knowledge base and the methodological tool-kit needed for more advanced coursework in music. We will study major works, that are representative of these style periods, and get to know and understand them though listening, analysis, criticism and contextual history. Over the course of the semester you will encounter and try out some of the major musicological approaches ranging from contextual cultural history, listening as analysis, critical interpretation, and music history as detective work. There is no formal prerequisite, but since the course is designed for students who anticipate majoring or minoring in music it is expected that students enrolling in the course will have some musical background and basic music-reading skills.<br><br><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> MUSCÂ 121 or permission<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> Offered every year<br><br></div>		</td>
