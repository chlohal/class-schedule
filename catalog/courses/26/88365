<div><h3>PSYC 070 - The Pursuit of Happiness </h3>  <p><hr>What is happiness? What are different cultural views of happiness and how to achieve it? Do our pursuits for happiness actually make us happy? How can misconceptions about the pursuit of happiness lead to dissatisfaction and distress? In this First Year Intensive (FYI) seminar, we will explore these and other questions by considering research findings from positive psychology, cognitive science, clinical psychology, and experiential learning activities. We will identify our own definitions of happiness, and consider how values, compassion, and well-being relate to our conceptions of happiness.</p>
