<div><h3>MGMT 5900 - Special Topics in Management </h3>  <p><hr>Each year, the Graduate School of Management offers courses under the &#8220;special topics&#8221; category. These courses are often different each semester and can be either .5 or one unit courses.</p>

<p>May count as an Experiential Learning Requirement II for the MBA program, depending on the topic.</p>

<p>FALL 2020 TOPIC: CORP GOV &amp; DIVERSITY</p>

<p>Corporate governance involves the rules, practices and processes by which companies are managed and governed. This course explores relationships among management, boards of directors, and shareholders. It gives students an inside look into boardroom dynamics, a realm often characterized as a &#8220;black box&#8221; for outside observers, and the elusive director selection process with a focus on diversity. It also addresses company relationships with stakeholders more broadly, including employees, customers, suppliers, stakeholder communities and, more generally, society. Increased investor attention to environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues, particularly as they relate to diversity, and the board&#8217;s role in addressing these criteria are a key component of the course. We will also examine the impacts of regulations such as diversity mandates and quotas on firm performance and society at large, and analyze a variety of corporate scandals to see what lessons can be learned to improve corporate governance. While the course is primarily concerned with companies based in the U.S., it also explores key corporate governance issues involving companies based in other parts of the world, such as Europe and Asia. Guest speakers will be invited to talk about their experiences as board members, business leaders, and/or corporate governance experts.<br><br><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Prerequisites vary depending on the course.<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> Varies<br><br></p></div>		</td>
