<div><h3>PHIL 133 - Reason and Political Disagreement </h3>  <hr>In this course, we will investigate the role that reason and rational argument play in the fractious and diverse debates typical of so much of contemporary politics, and we will do so by examining one particular debate in detail. This is a Problems of Practice course and, as such, we will not only study the relevant, highly regarded arguments, but we will also engage with real world participants and stakeholders in the debate, seeing first hand the real-world impact of abstract arguments and theorizing. We pay particular attention to how rational argument functions and whether or not such argument provides promise for healing these divides.<br><br><strong>Course Designation/Attribute:</strong> POP<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> periodicaaly<br><br></div>		</td>
