<div><h3>IDND 020 - Writing: Life Among Beasts </h3>  <p><hr>This course focuses on human-animal relationships in places shared by both. Many of us have pets or encounter undomesticated creatures in our daily lives, but what are the boundaries that exist between us or define our differences? How are these determined by the spaces we share and our gendered constructions of identities and relationships? Why are certain species demonized in popular narratives? And what is with all those cat memes?Â </p>

<p>This is a writing-centered course that will emphasize two dichotomous modes in the essay genre: the personal essay and the research essay. Students will engage in formal and informal writing exercises inspired and drawn from course readings and other media. You will learn in a supportive, welcoming environment and build crucial skills-including critical thinking, writing, and debating-that will increase your confidence and success in other courses.<br><br><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> VE placement or completion of IDND 18<br><br><strong>Course Designation/Attribute:</strong> VE<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> Spring 2020<br><br></p></div>		</td>
