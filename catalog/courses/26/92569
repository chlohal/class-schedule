<div><h3>PHIL 123 - Socrates and Athens </h3>  <hr>Why did the Athenians execute Socrates, one of the greatest philosophers of antiquity and, indeed, of human history?  This course will explore that question from a variety of perspectives.  We&#8217;ll begin with the writings of ancient historians to set the context, and then we&#8217;ll explore the complicated cross-currents of Athenian political and moral attitudes through political pamphlets, coutroom oratory, comic plays, model speeches by ancient &#8220;sophists&#8221;, and tragic theater.  In the process, we&#8217;ll take a deep look at some of the main representations of Socrates by the writers Plato and Xenophon; and we&#8217;ll pay special attention to his trial, trying to assess just how his intellectual views may have led to his conviction.<br><br><strong>Course Designation/Attribute:</strong> VP<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> Annually<br><br></div>		</td>
