<div><h3>MUSC 128 - Music and Words </h3>  <p><hr>Music and Words is a First Year Seminar designed for students interested in exploring the intersections of music and the word, from art song, musicals and opera, to songwriting and the great American songbook. The course is intended to shed light on the vast social, cultural and political implications of text setting throughout Western history. The course has no pre-requisites and requires no theoretical background in music but students will be expected to learn theoretical terms and engage in intelligent dialogue at a level approximate to an advanced aficionado of the repertoire studied.  The coursework will include significant reading and listening assignments as well as written work, discussion and student presentations.</p>
