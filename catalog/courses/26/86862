<div><h3>SOC 137 - Race and Ethnicity Across Borders: Comparing the Local and Global </h3>  <p><hr>Using a comparative framework, this seminar will examine the concepts of race and ethnicity in local, national, and global locations. Particular emphasis will be on race and ethnicity in changing cultural and political contexts in an ever-changing, globally connected world. For example, how have the events of September 11 in New York determined and constructed racial and ethnic identities? What are social, cultural, and political dynamics that shape racial identities and ethnic stereotypes? Why do derogatory racial labels get attached to people? How do ethnic groups get defined in volatile contexts? Students will read autobiographies and biographies to explore how formative racial and ethnic experiences have shaped their own lives and identities and those of others who have documented their lives in books and on film. What can we learn from these racial and ethnic imaginations that can help us theorize race and ethnicity across borders through sophisticated and sensitive theoretical frameworks?</p>
