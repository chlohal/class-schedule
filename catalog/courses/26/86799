<div><h3>PSYC 361 - Human Neuropsychology </h3>  <hr>This course provides a broad overview of neuropsychology graduate students. The goal of the course is to provide students with knowledge of brain and behavior relationships. Students will learn how the brain governs primary cognitive domains such as memory, attention, executive functions, and intelligence. It will also examine the neuropsychological tests used to evaluate the various cognitive domains. Students become familiar with the format and type of information provided in neuropsychological reports, and we will discuss some of the disorders typically seen in individuals referred for neuropsychological evaluations such as dementias, traumatic brain injury, learning disabilities, ADHD etc.<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> Offered every other year<br><br></div>		</td>
