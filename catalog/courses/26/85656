<div><h3>ENG 107 - Creative Writing: Poetry </h3>  <p><hr>Creative Writing: Poetry/Workshop A significant part of the class will be dedicated to exploring each student&#8217;s poetry through a constructive workshop approach. Each week, students will respond to prompts that focus on specific source material, poetic devices, or both. The course encourages participants to be open to a wide range of poetic styles and influences as they embark on writing assignments and critiques, and to look closely at the work of established poets. As the semester progresses, students will experiment with revision and create a portfolio of poems representing their best work. For undergraduate English majors and minors, this course satisfies the Genre (C-1) requirement. For undergraduate Creative Writing minors, this course counts as one of the introductory courses.</p>
