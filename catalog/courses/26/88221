<div><h3>HIST 050 - Revolutions in Europe and the Americas </h3>  <p><hr>Revolutions have been important in the construction of the world in which we live. These sudden bouts of political, military, and social upheaval not only led to regime change, but in the period from 1688 to 1848 put an end to a world based on privilege and laid the foundations for one that was more egalitarian. Through the lens of both primary and secondary documents, this course will introduce students to the main events that made up the revolutions as well as the concepts that proponents and opponents of revolution in Europe and the Americas discussed. Â </p>

<p>This course has been designed to introduce entering students to the college-level experience of informed and conceptually-grounded discussion of a major topic in human culture. The writing and speaking skills students develop here will help them meet the expectations of Clark&#8217;s liberal arts curriculum. In addition, it will introduce them to the research methodologies employed in the study of History, and provide them with a platform from which to consider their own educational goals.<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> Bi-annually<br><br></p></div>		</td>
