<div><h3>MSIT 3220 - Social Media Enterprise Intergration </h3>  <hr>Web 2.0 is a ubiquitous buzzword these days. It has broad implications in the internet world and includes Social Networking, WiKi, audio and video podcasting, blogging, and more. If you would you like to learn how to harness the power of the new Internet applications and media tools in a highly networked world, this class will provide you a good theoretical and practical understanding. The questions this class will explore fall into two general categories. First, what are the social and business implications of these new technologies? For example, are we using new media in an appropriate way? Are there or will there be losers and winners from a social and business context? Second, we will look at the technologies themselves to understand their level of complexity and how consumers and businesses can use or implement them appropriately. This will be an interactive class where students will share ideas and experiences and will gain exposure to tools that can be used to boost their marketing and communications objectives.<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> Varies<br><br></div>		</td>
