<div><h3>ENG 006 - College Writing </h3>  <p><hr>This course is designed to support entering first-year students to explore, practice, and challenge academic writing. To that end, we will read a range of texts (e.g., peer-reviewed research articles; autobiographical essays written by academics; conceptual or theoretical pieces), and try on different genres of academic writing (e.g., synthesis papers, personal narratives, thesis or argument-driven papers, abstracts or synthesis papers of a longer text)-with the goal of developing and honing different techniques and strategies that will prepare you for the demands of reading and writing in university classrooms. In that process, we will also engage with our own identities as readers and writers (as well as young people of color in the academy), and question the norms and commonplace beliefs about academic writing.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Throughout the course we will wrestle with the following questions:</p>

<p>•             What makes academic writing &#8220;academic&#8221;?</p>

<p>•             What is my &#8220;voice&#8221; as a writer? How can I develop multiple voices?</p>

<p>•             What is the relationship between reading and writing academic texts?</p>

<p>•             What are some differences in writing across academic disciplines? (e.g., writing in biology versus writing in    sociology?)</p>

<p>•             What role does audience play in how I write?</p>

<p>•             What are some resources &#8211; as a reader and writer of academic texts&#8211; that I am bringing to the university?</p>

<p>•             What are some of my fears and concerns about academic writing?</p>

<p>•             What are some common or popular genres/format of academic writing?</p>
