<div><h3>AS 210 - Disability in East Asia and Beyond </h3>  <hr>This interdisciplinary course explores what it means to be disabled in both theory and practice, especially in East Asian contexts. We begin by closely examining the concept of &#8220;disability&#8221; and its various connotations and end with recent, more radical ways of thinking about disability. The course is framed by feminist approaches to definitions and applications of disability theory, drawing further on literary and technological approaches to representation of minority subjects.<br><br><strong>Course Designation/Attribute:</strong> VE; DI<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> Annually<br><br></div>		</td>
