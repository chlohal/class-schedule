<div><h3>ARTS 274 - Contemporary Directions </h3>  <p><hr>This course will explore the subjects, issues and themes that are important to artists working today. As a Diversity &amp; Inclusion (D &amp; I) designated course, content will center on artists from underrepresented groups and the impact their work has on the cannon of visual art and culture. Students will research a roster of artists including Theaster Gates, Maya Lin, Felix Gonzales Torres, El Anatsui, Carmen Herrera, Ghada Amer, Bill Traylor, and Judith Scott, among many others. Featured artists will address a variety of topics, including race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, nationality, age, religion, class, and ability/accessibility. Emphasis will be placed on the positionality of artists and audiences, structures of power within cultural institutions, and intersectionality as a compounding form of discrimination. Students will be expected to actively participate in discussions, complete all readings, short writing assignments, and projects. Two long-term projects will be assigned in which each student selects a contemporary artist to research and create a body of art work in response. Course projects will investigate the lived experience of diverse artists and how identity is and is not reflected in aesthetic images and objects.     </p>
