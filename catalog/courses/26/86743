<div><h3>PSYC 235 - Research on Diverse Families and Sexualities </h3>  <p><hr>This course involves undergraduates in all phases of ongoing research being conducted in the Diverse Families and Sexualities Laboratory of Professor Abbie Goldberg. The primary project that Dr. Goldberg&#8217;s team is working is The Transition to Adoptive Parenthood Project, a 15 year longitudinal study of heterosexual, lesbian, and gay adoptive parents, most of whom have adopted transracially, which focuses on parents&#8217; experiences in a wide range of settings (e.g., their communities; their children&#8217;s schools). The most recent set of interviews with parents concerns how they navigate their child&#8217;s transition to puberty.</p>

<p>Students will participate in weekly lab meetings. Students will also participate in transcribing participant interviews, coding data, entering data, and assisting with other lab tasks. To be accepted into the lab, students must: complete an application (see Dr. Goldberg&#8217;s website); meet a minimum GPA requirement; interview with Dr. Goldberg and a doctoral student; be able to articulate the intersection between their interests and career goals and the foci of/opportunities provided by the lab; and be able to commit to one year in the lab.</p>

<p>Prerequisites for this course require a grade of C- or better</p>

<p><strong>This course fulfills the Lab/Research requirement of the Psychology major.</strong></p>
