<div><h3>EDUC 300 - Special Topics </h3>  <p><hr>This &#8220;special topics&#8221; seminar combines (i) an in-depth examination of the concept of epistemic injustice, and theories of social inequality as they relate to epistemic injustice, with (ii) fieldwork to explore the theory/practice conundrum.  It also supports exploration into praxis &#8211; what it takes to disrupt community-based and educational settings in the service of epistemic justice.  Participants will read a variety of philosophical and social science texts, link theories of epistemic injustice to fieldwork in school and after-school settings, all in the service of promoting more equitable educational outcomes.</p>

<p>The seminar focuses on epistemic (or knowledge-building) tools designed to disrupt epistemic injustice.  A key goal is deepening understanding of epistemic tools as levers of change in teaching/learning contexts.  Readings will interrogate theories of social inequality - at the macro and micro level - with emphasis on the micro: the complexities of teaching and learning in urban classrooms for social justice.  In addition to the seminar, the class will also involve 3 hours per week of fieldwork in a teaching/learning site (TBD, depending on the site selected).</p>
