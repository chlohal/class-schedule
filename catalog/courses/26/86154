<div><h3>ID 125 - Tales from the Far Side: Contemporary Dilemmas in Development </h3>  <hr><span style="font-family:verdana;font-size:8.5pt;">Discussions of geopolitics invariably refer to the problems of Third World or &#8216;under&#8217; development. What is so compelling about the idea of development? Why does it ail much of the so-called Third World? What are some of the solutions to development dilemmas: neoliberal market reforms or social justice programming attention to women, ethnic groups and/or the environment? Is the development enterprise fundamentally flawed as some postcolonial scholars claim? This course introduces students to key histories, concepts and debates in international development through critical and analytical engagements with fiction, films and theoretical literature on the subject.</span><br><br><strong>Course Designation/Attribute:</strong> GP<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> Annually<br><br></div>		</td>
