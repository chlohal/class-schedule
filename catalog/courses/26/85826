<div><h3>GEOG 022 - Why Global Warming Matters I </h3>  <hr>Climate change (global warming)is the single greatest problem facing the planet today. Or is it? In this seminar students will peel away the rhetoric surrounding global climate change, so that they may be able to understand why this issue matters not only to international policy makers but also to individuals and their daily lives. Topics for exploration will focus on the causes and consequences of climate change and justification (and options) for action. The breadth of areas the climate-change issue intersects - including but not limited to politics, economy, ecology, epistemology, ethics - suggests that global warming is a crucial integrating theme for the discipline of geography and, more importantly, the intellectual foundation of a well-rounded student. Fulfills the Values Perspective (VP). Offered periodically as a first year seminar and as a lecture course.<br><br><strong>Course Designation/Attribute:</strong> VP<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> Offered periodically<br><br></div>		</td>
