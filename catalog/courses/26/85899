<div><h3>GEOG 337 - Feminism, Nature and Culture </h3>  <hr>The purpose of this course is to expose students to major currents of contemporary social theory that have developed around &#8220;nature&#8221; and &#8220;woman&#8221; or nature and gender. We will explore a number of important contemporary topics including: biotechnology and &#8220;life,&#8221; food and identity, the body/science/fashion, human and nonhuman animal relations, and the manner in which conceptualizations of nature and of women (or gender roles) mutually constitute and reinforce one another. Our principal goals are to analyze and critique the normative idea of what is &#8220;nature&#8221; or what is &#8220;natural&#8221; as it pertains to gender, environmental processes, other life forms, and human social and economic existence in general. Because feminists have been instrumental in leading much of this analysis and critique, we lean heavily on feminist theories. We will explore these ideas through science fiction, magical realism, cartoons, movies, other fiction, social histories and biographies. By the end of the semester, students should be adept at decoding representations of nature and gender in the popular media as well as in academic scholarship. Students should also have a reasonable understanding of the development of and debates surrounding biotechnology and gender, identity and gender, and ecofeminist thought. Open to doctoral and masters students.<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> Offered every other year<br><br></div>		</td>
