<div><h3>HIST 252 - The Holocaust Through Diaries and Letters </h3>  <p><hr> </p>
<p>The aim of this course is to engage in a bifocal understanding of history: from the perspective of those who experienced events as they unfolded, and from our vantage point today. Our goal is to recognize anew the potentiality of an unfolding present when many options are available, and to analyze the factors that conduced to the decisions and choices we now know were taken. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>What did people know, and when did they know it? What role did denial and silence play? What, if any, patterns of daily life choices emerge? Do specific human traits or values loom large when life is lived <i>in extremis</i>?<br><br><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Any HGS course<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> Bi-annually<br><br></p></div>		</td>
