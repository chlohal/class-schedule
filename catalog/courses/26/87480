<div><h3>CJ 2250 - The Criminal Mind </h3>  <hr>We will explore the profiles of the criminal personality in all of its ramifications, offering fresh perceptions into crimes in the spotlight today, from rape and domestic violence to the serial and charismatic killers. Who are these criminals and how and why do they act differently from responsible citizens? We will study the violent crime scene analysis and the key to understanding and catching violent criminals. Particular attention will be paid to the principles behind the defense of insanity as well as whether or not the defense of diminished capacity either excuses or diminishes the guilt of one who is charged with a serious crime.<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> varies<br><br></div>		</td>
