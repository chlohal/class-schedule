<div><h3>ENG 350 - Medieval Literature </h3>  <p><hr>Explores medieval literary culture of Western Europe by means of literary theoretical and classical texts. Themes vary each year, and the seminar can be taken more than once for credit, as long as each time a different theme is chosen.</p>

<p><strong>SPRING 2021 - The Arthurian Tradition</strong></p>

<p>Centuries of combined myth, legend, and history resulted in the most popular and enduring stories in medieval literature. Arthur and Guinevere, the sorcerer Merlin, the lustful Uther Pendragon, Sir Gawain, Sir Lancelot, Sir Perceval, and the Knights of the Round Table have outlived most popular literary characters from the Middle Ages, and continue to fascinate readers and audiences. This class will examine the tales&#8217; Celtic and British roots, the golden age of French romance, take a detour to medieval Iceland, and examine the Arthurian tradition&#8217;s transformative influence on mainstream English literature. All texts but those in Middle English will be read in Modern English translation; no previous Middle English knowledge is required.<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> Periodically<br><br></p></div>		</td>
