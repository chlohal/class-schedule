<div><h3>GEOG 361 - Decision Methods for Environmental Management and Policy </h3>  <hr>Information on environmental-impact assessments needs to be systematically organized and analyzed to be useful in the decision-making process. This course provides a survey of methods that are currently used to aid environmental decision makers (who include policy makers, environmental managers and affected populations). Covers techniques such as: decision analysis, benefit/cost analysis, multicriteria evaluation, multiobjective analysis, multiattribute utility theory, the analytical hierarchy process, and spatial-analytical methods using geographical information systems. These methods will be evaluated with respect to their theoretical foundations, systems formulation and appropriate application. A critical evaluation of the strengths and weaknesses of these methods will also be discussed. Open to doctoral and masters students. Advanced undergraduates require instuctor permission to register.<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> Offered every year/<br><br></div>		</td>
