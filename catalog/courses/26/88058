<div><h3>MCA 282 - Radio Journalism and Podcasting in the Arts and Beyond </h3>  <p><hr>Since it began sending news and entertainment over the airways a century ago, radio has proved the most resilient medium on the planet. Audio broadcasting still attracts audiences today, whether in the many shows from National Public Radio or the more recent profusion of online podcasts on almost every subject.</p>

<p>In this course, students will learn how to create and broadcast their own radio stories and audio podcasts-including how to interview, write, record, edit, voice, and produce high quality products. The course will also focus on team and individual projects that turn out creative radio shows and more personalized podcasts built around the interests and talents of the students creating them.</p>

<p>While there will be ample opportunity to focus on arts and culture, almost any other area will be fair game as well.</p>
