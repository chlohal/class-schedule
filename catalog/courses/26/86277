<div><h3>IDCE 30218 - Community Development Decision Making & Negotiations </h3>  <p><hr>Planning and community development involve negotiation at almost every level. Many stakeholder and community processes reveal conflicting visions of desired outcomes, influenced by underlying values, aspirations, and positions of power and interest. Through this course, students realize that not all negotiations are zero sum, whereby a gain on one side must equal a loss on the other. The role of conflict can be transformative in pushing participants to engage in dialogue, which can lead to knowledge about other perspectives and discovery of new ideas that move difficult processes forward. This work requires authentic listening to understand weighted interests and differences in culture and worldview. Students who take this course will learn to embrace the role of conflict, negotiation, and mediation as steps toward achieving better outcomes; develop confidence in participating in and leading principled negotiations; and develop skills in problem solving, identification of weighted interests, process design, and creative strategies. The course is open to Clark University graduate students and prospective ADP students in their senior year, who would take this as a graduate level course. </p>
