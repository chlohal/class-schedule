<div><h3>IDCE 30205 - Climate Change, Energy and Development </h3>  <p><hr><p style="margin-left:5.1pt;">This course explores climate change, energy and development from multiple perspectives, disciplines and scales. Fusing perspectives from both the natural and social sciences, this interdisciplinary course will grapple with diverse themes and issues at the intersection of environmental science and policy. Climate change related topics deal with the evolving science of climate change, current observations, extreme weather and long term impacts, in addition to climate ethics and international climate governance. Our analysis of climate change will also include an examination of geoengineering, carbon capture and storage and the phenomenon of climate denial. Energy related themes deal with renewable energy (wind and solar), gas fracking, methane hydrates and an examination of the pros and cons of nuclear energy. Development dimensions then deal with human dimensions of climate change and energy challenges and address ethical and economic perspectives, diet and food and human security. This is a graduate level course, required for all Environmental Science and Policy (ES&amp;P) graduate students.Â </p>
