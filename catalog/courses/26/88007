<div><h3>MUSC 235 - Community Music and Social Action </h3>  <p><hr>How can artists and arts managers/administrators contribute as citizens of a democracy? In what ways can people committed to the arts serve the wider world through their work? In this course, we will explore arts education and policy as it relates to positive social change, and examine artistic initiatives that have been focused on positive social impact.</p>

<p>In this course we will develop a response to these questions, and we will explore the notion that the classical musician, the artist, is an important public figure with a critical role to play in society. The course will include inquiry into a set of ideas in philosophy of aesthetics; a discussion about freedom, civil society, and ways that art can play a role in readying people for democracy; discussion on philosophy of education as it relates to the question of positive social change; and an exploration of musical and artistic initiatives that have been particularly focused on a positive social impact.</p>

<p>We will examine these questions from the perspective of theorists, educators, teachers, administrators and artists. All participants will have hands-on opportunities to engage with the community as part of the course, including working with youth in Neighborhood Strings, a free music program for the at-risk population of Main South, and/or interning with the Worcester Chamber Music Society or other prominent local arts organizations.</p>
