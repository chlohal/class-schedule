<div><h3>WGS 240 - Special Topics: Women&#8217;s and Gender Studies </h3>  <p><hr>This course addresses current or timely topics in the area of Women&#8217;s and Gender Studies. Topics can vary from semester to semester.</p>

<p><strong>Spring 2021 Topic: BLACK FEMINIST THOUGHT </strong>This course engages in critical examination of the key issues, assumptions, debates and political commitments that populate Black feminist thought. Foregrounding the centrality of Black feminism to anti-racism, resistance to gender oppression, and the emergence of the queer of color critique, this class centralizes Black women&#8217;s experiences as multiply minoritized and multiply marginalized members of our contemporary global and political landscape. We will analyze seminal theoretical texts and recent scholarship to work through the issues and questions that they raise. The overall aim of this course is to link, if not locate, contemporary feminist theories and practices with widely encompassing traditions of women&#8217;s political activism, theory, and cultural production. This class will be a capstone course, and will include a final paper showcasing students&#8217; original research.   </p>
