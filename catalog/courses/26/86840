<div><h3>SCRN 225 - National Cinema </h3>  <p><hr>Issues in National and Regional Cinemas. Variable topics.</p>

<p>Spring 2021 Topic: Turkey</p>

<p>This course provides a survey and critical assessment of national cinema in Turkey from the mid 20th century to the contemporary moment. We will analyze representations of race and ethnicity, gender and sex, and religion. A key component of the course will be an examination of whiteness in cinema and how race plays a key role in determining national identity and transnational relations. The course will cover topics such as nationalism, Islamization, queer diasporas, Turkish-Kurdish issue, minority policies, and women&#8217;s rights through the films of acclaimed filmmakers such as Yılmaz Guney, Tomris Giritlioglu, Ferzan Ozpetek, Nuri Bilge Ceylan, and Yeşim Ustaoglu. Besides fiction and nonfiction films, students will also learn about a nontheatrical film culture in Turkey during the Cold War era and analyze the country&#8217;s geopolitical importance in relation to the American politics. Additionally, we will explore the U.S. soft power, taste politics, and copyrights issues in the context of Turkey&#8217;s remakes of American films (such as The Wizard of Oz and Star Wars). Furthermore, we will also investigate the representation of Turkey in American cinema to discuss the function of diplomacy, stereotyping, memory, and race in relation to influencing public opinion and legal cases. Lastly, our discussions will incorporate an analysis of film production, exhibition, distribution, and reception in festival circuits, social media, and digital streaming platforms.  <br><br><strong>Course Designation/Attribute:</strong> GP<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> Offered every other year<br><br></p></div>		</td>
