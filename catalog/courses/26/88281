<div><h3>IDCE 30112 - Housing Policy and Practice </h3>  <p><hr>People&#8217;s ability to secure safe, affordable housing is essential to building community and thriving economically.  Yet in many places, this goal remains elusive. This master&#8217;s level course delves into the history, policy, and development practices that shape housing production today. The course work focuses on the practical application of housing development, including how national and local housing development polices and planning shape neighborhoods.  Through this work, students will develop a critical introduction to the field of housing development with a focus on equity as a framework for planners and community developers.   </p>
