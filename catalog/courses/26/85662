<div><h3>ENG 122 - Terror of the Gothic </h3>  <hr>In this course, we will explore our delight in terror through the world of nineteenth-century Gothic fiction, novels like Mary Shelley&#8217;s <em>Frankenstein</em> and Bram Stoker&#8217;s <em>Dracula</em>, a world of pain and destruction, fear and anxiety. In tracing the recurrent themes of sin, family dynamics, politics, and nature within Gothic fiction, we will examine both the relationship of this fiction to the dominant culture of the nineteenth century, as well as to social and political revolution. Following current literary scholarship, we will pose questions about representations of violence; the significance of fantasy and fear; and the role of gender, race, class and sexuality in this body of work. Throughout the course, we will examine the legacy of this fiction in our modern cultural obsession with horror through film. This course satisfies the Verbal Expression (VE) requirement.
