<div><h3>ARTS 158 - Printmaking I: Low -Tech to HighTech </h3>  <p><hr>This course will cover a range of basic to more complicated printmaking techniques and students will gain hands on experience in making multiple images. To begin, students will have an opportunity to work with easy low-tech methods such as collagraphs, linoleum plates, monotyping, drypoint, wood cut, and solar plates.  Students will be encouraged to hand-color or add to the prints, incorporating drawing, painting, copier-printing, book and zine making and collage. From there the course will expand to cover the technical and process-oriented fundamentals of intaglio printmaking through mechanical and chemical copper plate etching. Exploring multiple and serial imagery in historical and contemporary printmaking will provide a context for investigation. The goal of these techniques is to gain flexibility and skill with each medium, develop more creativity and self-expression while using non-toxic and low toxicity methods and materials. Open to non-majors.</p>

<p>Fulfills Aesthetic Perspective.</p>

<p>Students will be charged a V &amp; PA lab fee upon registering for this course.<br><br><strong>Course Designation/Attribute:</strong> AP<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> Offered every year<br><br></p></div>		</td>
