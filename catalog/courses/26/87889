<div><h3>PSCI 091 - The Politics of Food </h3>  <p><hr>How are policies surrounding food production and nutrition developed? Who influences these policy decisions and in what ways?  What are some of the consequences of these policies, as well as other efforts to promote healthy and sustainable food production?  What are some of the ethical issues surrounding food production and consumption?  How can we understand the recent rise in interest for local, organic food? Should the government actively promote these food choices?  This class will explore these questions, studying the ways that the U.S. government designs and implements policies and programs to ensure an affordable and nutritionally adequate food supply.   In the process, we will also look at some of the social, cultural, economic, ethical, and institutional factors that influence agriculture, food, and nutrition policies, programs, and choices.</p>
