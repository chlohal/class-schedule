<div><h3>ENG 230 - Reading Voraciously: Food and Literature in the 20th Century </h3>  <hr>To claim that &#8220;cooking can produce something that approaches an aesthetic emotion,&#8221; was daring in 1954, when Alice Toklas situated herself among the modernists with the bold claim that cooking was a form of art. Yet she was also situating herself within a long literary and philosophical tradition of thinking aesthetic taste alongside gustatory taste. Taking up the idea of food as an aesthetic phenomenon, this course traces a transnational history of literary thinking about food within the long twentieth century, with special attention to the relationship between food and such identity categories as gender, sexuality, race, and ethnicity. For undergraduate English majors, this course satisfies the Period (D-3) requirement or the Theory (E) requirement but does not double-count. Meets the Aesthetic Perspective (AP) requirement. Fulfills the Diversity and Inclusion (D&amp;I) requirement.<br><br><strong>Course Designation/Attribute:</strong> AP, DI<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> Bi-annually<br><br></div>		</td>
