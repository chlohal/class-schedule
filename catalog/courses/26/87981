<div><h3>PSYC 050 - The Psychology of Prejudice </h3>  <hr>Psychology of Prejudice<br>
Why does prejudice exist? How does it affect ourselves, our relationships, and our society? In this first-year intensive, we we will explore these questions by turning to the scientific literature. Students will explore a variety of topics in the psychology of prejudice, including cognitive processing (e.g., categorization, activation, application), content and structure, expression, sociostructural causes and consequences (e.g.,power, status, threat), and their reduction or elimination (e.g., prejudice reduction, intergroup interactions, social change). Throughout the seminar, we will discuss a variety of different prejudices, including prejudice against racial minorities, sexual minorities, women and marginalized genders, and other social groups. The goals of this course are to (1) provide students with an in-depth understanding of prejudice and how they affect social and political reality, (2) critically examine theory and metatheory guiding research on stereotypes and prejudice, and (3) learn how researchers study stereotypes and prejudice.<br><br><strong>Course Designation/Attribute:</strong> GP, DI<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> Biennially<br><br></div>		</td>
