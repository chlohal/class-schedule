<div><h3>MCA 285 - New Media, Youth Action & Social Change </h3>  <hr>This course explores the ways in which global communications has been restructured and redefined as a result of the democratization of new media technologies. We will be dealing with the theoretical, practical, social, cultural and ideological shifts in the field of global (and local) emerging technologies, with a special focus on internet technologies and its impact on youth action and social change. The class material will feature case-studies from diverse countries in Asia, Africa, Latin America, North America, Europe and Australia to compare, contrast and analyze the connection between such emerging media, youth activism and social change. The unique narratives that emerge from these diverse regions in the context of emerging technologies as a social force will be explored. The extent to which this shift supports the democratization of the multi-media sphere and how it has redefined the ethical and applied futures of the field of communication will be critically examined. A holistic goal of this course is to broaden your understanding of this phenomenon&#8212;to learn how to tie the global with local, theory with praxis.<br><br><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> CSAC 101 (or COMM 101)<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> bi-annually<br><br></div>		</td>
