<div><h3>PSCI 205 - U.S. Campaigns and Elections </h3>  <p><hr>Examines election and campaigns from a number of different perspectives: the theoretical underpinnings of American elections, their historical development, the rules by which campaigns are governed, and the strategies that candidates follow in pursuit of office. Although the focus is almost exclusively on national (presidential and congressional) elections, it is the goal of the course to examine the process of elections from a standpoint that will enable students to understand and analyze the electoral process at various levels of government. The primary system, the role of the media, and the issue of campaign finance, among other topics, are also explored.</p>
