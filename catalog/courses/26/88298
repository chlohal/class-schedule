<div><h3>HIST 085 - Introduction to African History </h3>  <hr>This course will cover the history of the African continent, from antiquity to the present era. It will begin with the emergence of early African civilizations and their evolution into kingdoms and empires, focusing on their political organization, culture, and trade. It will then explore the rise of colonialism, the persistence of African societies under colonialism, and African resistance to it. The course will then turn to the emerging independence movements on the continent in the twentieth century, followed by the development of new political states. We will examine the challenges faced by post-colonial societies including the impact of colonial constructions of race. The course will emphasize the experience of African peoples as they built and transformed politically, economically, and culturally across these eras, as well as the ways in which Africans trade networks were situated in global ones. After completing the course, students will be able connect the themes covered in class to a greater understanding of global history and societies, which they can carry to all their areas of study.<br><br><strong>Course Designation/Attribute:</strong> HP and DI<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> Bi-annually<br><br></div>		</td>
