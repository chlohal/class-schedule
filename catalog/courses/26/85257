<p>Fall 2020 Topic: Greek Archaeology in the Digital Age</p>

<p>This course explores the material culture of ancient Greece - the pots, temples, and tombs - and the people who made them. We will journey through over 5000 years of ancient Greek culture and history, exploring the earliest Neolithic societies through Alexander the Great. We&#8217;ll learn about an ancient analog computer and how it was preserved underwater; we&#8217;ll debate cultural identities represented in the infamous Griffin Warrior tomb; we&#8217;ll discover how some poleis manipulated religious histories for political benefit. Through a series of hands-on digital laboratories, we will also learn about the latest analytical methods employed by archaeologists. You will leave this class with a clear understanding of how ancient Greek culture evolved, and how archaeologists have assembled and analyzed this evidence. This is a class about connecting material culture and people; you&#8217;ll become more aware of how your footprints record your identity, and how archaeologists thousands of years from now might reinterpret them. . </p>
