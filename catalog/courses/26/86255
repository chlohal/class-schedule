<div><h3>IDCE 390 - CDP Research Seminar </h3>  <p><hr>This seminar prepares students for writing a final research paper, which is one of the IDCE 12th Final Unit Options necessary for graduation. Students will prepare proposals for one of the three possible kinds of projects: (1) research paper; (2) practitioner paper or (3) thesis. The seminar focuses on producing a strong navigational chart for these projects, creating a fluid proposal for a doable (and meaningful) project. Through this interactive course, students will work to define an appropriate research question (neither too broad nor too narrow), identify sources that frame this question, and develop an appropriate methodology, including steps to assemble primary or secondary data in a timely way.  The course is open to Clark University graduate students and prospective ADP students in their senior year, who would take this as a graduate level course.  This course fulfills requirements for Skills/ Methods.</p>
