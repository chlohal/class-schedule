<div><h3>ENG 120 - Introduction to Shakespeare </h3>  <hr>This course takes a deep dive into 16th and 17th Century culture by way of an introduction to the works of William Shakespeare. We will read small selections of poetry as well as plays covering the genres of history, tragedy, romance, and comedy. Our discussions will explore topics of gender, sexuality, disability, race, religion, and class and, as such, will develop your skills of literary analysis. We will also use our readings to examine the ways that Shakespeare has expanded into a modern cultural phenomenon in film and theatre. Your short writing assignments will serve to supplement our discussions, while a general introduction to archival methods and digitized rare books will help provide some context to Shakespeare&#8217;s era. For undergraduate English majors this course satisfies the Period (D-1) requirement.<br><br><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> VEÂ Prerequisite<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> Periodically<br><br></div>		</td>
