<div><h3>HIST 153 - Europe in the Age of Extremes: the 20th Century </h3>  <hr>This course serves as an introduction into the political, social and cultural history of Europe from the beginning to the end of the 20th century. The survey is concerned with World War I and World War II, and with the nature of postwar stabilization and recovery. It focuses on the rise of dictatorships and the radicalization of mass violence during the first half of the century, as well as on the developments toward democracy, peace and civil society since 1950. The course will conclude with an evaluation of the remaking of Eastern and Western Europe in the 1980s and 1990s, the return of war and genocide to Europe, and present debates on the future of Europe.<br><br><strong>Course Designation/Attribute:</strong> HP<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> Offered every year<br><br></div>		</td>
