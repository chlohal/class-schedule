<div><h3>PSCI 098 - Comic Books and Politics </h3>  <hr>Comic books are deeply political. They reflect both ongoing and historical political debates, as well as shifting political and social norms. In this course, we will engage with a range of national and global political issues, from racial justice and immigration in the United States to the Balkan wars, and explore how both contemporary and historical comic books engage with them. We will examine how the political messages in titles like Captain America and Wonder Woman have evolved over time, and how titles like Black Panther and V for Vendetta reflect contemporary political anxieties.Â <br><br><strong>Course Designation/Attribute:</strong> GP<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> Every three-four years<br><br></div>		</td>
