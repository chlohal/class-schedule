<div><h3>GEOG 343 - Human Dimensions of Global Change </h3>  <hr>Global environmental changes involve worldwide transformations of land, oceans and atmosphere, driven by human activities interwoven with natural processes. Its human dimensions involve the complex causes and consequences of people&#8217;s individual and collective actions.  This advanced seminar investigates the human dimensions of global environmental change, examining its socioeconomic, political and environmental causes and consequences.  We will explore urgent, complex social, environmental and management problems, such as changes in tropical forests, grasslands and urbanizing areas; climate change and global food security; emerging infectious diseases; social institutions, collective action and international environmental regimes; spatial methods in global land change research; global land grabs; climate adaption and mitigation; environmental equity and justice, and others. Open to doctoral and masters students.<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> every other fall<br><br></div>		</td>
