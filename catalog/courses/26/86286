<div><h3>IDCE 30231 - Humanitarian Assistances in Complex Emergencies/Disasters </h3>  <p><hr>Disasters and Complex Humanitarian Emergencies (DCHE) have become increasingly common. Within the context of an emerging global political economy, effective delivery of humanitarian assistance has become complex and controversial. This course explores the theoretical and policy issues in DCHE with an emphasis on the roles of governmental and nongovernmental organizations in them. Drawing from a wide variety of case studies, this course will focus on the factors that shape risks and the vulnerability of affected populations and responses of government and NGOs. This course will provide students with comprehensive insights into the needs and policy challenges in DCHE situations and equip them with the awareness, understanding and skills that are essential for effective service in a humanitarian crisis. It will be particularly useful for those interested in working with international and governmental organizations as well as NGOs. This is a reading-intensive, interdisciplinary course designed for a range of backgrounds and experiences.</p>
