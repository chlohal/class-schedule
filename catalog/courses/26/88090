<div><h3>MUSC 082 - Performance Workshop </h3>  <p><hr>The Music Program&#8217;s Performance Workshop offers music students instrumental study and performance opportunities outside of regular lessons. This class is perfect for incoming students who would like to begin performing in their first year of college or for students currently taking lessons who would like to enhance their performance skills. Students majoring in the performance track are strongly encouraged to take this course. All aesthetics and genres are taught, from classical and jazz to pop. Performers of all stripes are encouraged to enroll.</p>

<p>This class builds on important aspects of any training in performances such as cultivating repertoire, considering performance injury, practice techniques, mental focus, building instrumental technique, learning how to give, process and understand criticism and how to cultivate professionalism as a performing artist (resume building, cv building, how to take auditions, etc.)</p>
