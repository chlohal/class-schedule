<div><h3>TA 211 - Performance Philosophy </h3>  <p><hr>This course will serve as an introduction to an exciting new academic field called Performance Philosophy. Performance Philosophy is an international network of performers and researchers exploring the relationship between Philosophy and Performance, and is represented with a steadily increasing number of publications, performances, conferences and websites.  </p>

<p>Approaching the works as artists, we will consider, engage, and confront selected works of  philosophers Nietzsche, Plato, Sophocles, Hamlet, Samuel Beckett, the authors of the Cloud of the Unknowing and the Tao Te Ching, Robert Sardello, John Cage, Jean Baudrillard, Gilles Deleuze and Allan Kaprow, not to write more discourse, but through this &#8216;contagion&#8217; create vital new art works.</p>

<p>The course meets all day Fridays, with a seminar in the morning and the studio for developing new work in the afternoon.  Though this course is offered as an elective in Theatre, the course is open to V&amp;PA majors and to all Philosophy majors who have enough experience in an artistic discipline to sustain a working project throughout the semester. Students will have an opportunity to develop independent projects or work collaboratively on a site-specific performance piece under the direction of the instructor. Admission by interview.</p>

<p><em>This course may be repeatable for credit.</em><br><br><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Permission required. Permission obtained through interview with professor.<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> periodically<br><br></p></div>		</td>
