<div><h3>GEOG 370 - Development&#8217;s Geographies: Debates and Interventions </h3>  <p><hr>In what way can there be an area of inquiry called &#8220;development geography&#8221; in the same sense that there is a &#8220;development economics&#8221; or a &#8220;politics of development&#8221;? What would give this area of inquiry its coherence, and what would it contribute? This course addresses the geographies of development by exploring the intersections between development conceived of as the combined and uneven unfolding of capitalism(s), and development understood as a bundle of intentional interventions that seek to secure certain normative goals. We spend time discussing the institutional, political and discursive arrangements that mediate these intersections, the geographies they produce, and the diverse types of intervention pursued by states, civil society organizations, businesses, and community-based organizations. The course uses literatures from geography, anthropology, political science, economics and sociology, focusing particularly on debates around political settlements, institutional change, poverty and inequality, contentious politics, territory, livelihoods and resistance.</p>
