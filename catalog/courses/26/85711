<div><h3>ENG 290 - Capstone </h3>  <hr>During fall semester of senior year, the Capstone seminar offers English majors a final culminating experience, during which students demonstrate their sophisticated engagement with fundamental skills of literary criticism (astute close reading; persuasive argumentation; clear, elegant writing; comfort navigating conventions of citation and style; familiarity with broad contours of literary history; facility with a range of theoretical and scholarly methodologies) first through a shared reading of a text (or texts) on a common theme, and then with a major independent research project. Capstone provides opportunity for each student not only to demonstrate mastery of literary criticism but also to articulate the meaning and import of their own unique course of study in major. Each student develops their final independent project out of their specialized interest and expertise within the English major and/or their sense of interdisciplinary connections with a secondary major, minor, or concentration. For undergraduate English majors, this course satisfies the Capstone (F) requirement. Senior English majors only. Only offered in the fall.<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> Only offered in the fall.<br><br></div>		</td>
