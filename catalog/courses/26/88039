<div><h3>IDCE 30102 - Case Studies in Environmental Issues and Policy Analysis </h3>  <p><hr>Many environmental policy issues are considered &#8220;messy&#8221; problems. These types of complex problems are characterized by scientific uncertainty, difficulty making progress on one dimension without trading off progress on another, and differences in underlying values leading to very different decisions. Examples include evaluating the risks and benefits of new chemicals, managing the multiple uses of natural resources, and using nuclear energy for climate mitigation policy. Through a series of case studies, this course will introduce students to a range of approaches for structuring and analyzing complex environmental problems, including decision-tree analysis, value of information, benefit-cost analysis and benefit-risk analysis, multi-attribute analysis, data synthesis techniques, and uncertainty analysis. Students will gain a working knowledge of these methods and the strengths and limitation of the different approaches, be able to construct simple models using DecisionTools software, and communicate the results and uncertainties to decision-makers.</p>
