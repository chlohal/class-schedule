<p><span style="font-size:11pt;font-family:Calibri, 'sans-serif';">This upper level undergraduate (juniors and seniors) and graduate seminar examines some of the most significant policy issues that &#8220;developing&#8221; countries grapple with in their efforts to improve the capacity of &#8220;human resources&#8221; to meet the assumed<span class="apple-converted-space"> </span> needs of the new knowledge economy. The course focuses<span class="apple-converted-space"> </span>on key policy issues in a variety of national settings<span class="apple-converted-space"> </span>in the areas of governance, management, and financing of education. It examines the basic socio-economic needs and conditions that drive educational policy in<span class="apple-converted-space"> </span>&#8220;developing&#8221;<span class="apple-converted-space"> </span>countries, the practical and ideological considerations that influence policy responses, and the results and implications of various policy choices. While focusing on these broader issues, we explore the role of different stakeholders, including the state, local, regional and international organizations, and citizens in these policy debates and practices. Additionally, we will<span class="apple-converted-space"> </span>critically examine globalization&#8217;s impact on educational policy, particularly its ideological influence on the financial and management arrangements for the provision of education.<span class="apple-converted-space"> <br>
