<div><h3>GEOG 222 - Why Global Warming Matters </h3>  <hr>Climate change (a.k.a. &#8220;global warming&#8221;) is the single greatest problem facing the planet today. Or is it? In this course students will peel away the rhetoric surrounding global climate change, so that they may be able to understand why this issue matters not only to international policy makers but also to individuals and their daily lives. Topics for exploration will focus on the causes and consequences of climate change and justification (and options) for action. The breadth of areas the climate-change issue intersects - including but not limited to ecology, politics, economy, ethics - suggests that global warming is a crucial integrating theme for the discipline of geography and, more importantly, the intellectual foundation of a well-rounded student. Students will engage in quantitative and qualitative analysis.<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> Periodically<br><br></div>		</td>
