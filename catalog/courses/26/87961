<div><h3>HIST 308 - The Idea of History </h3>  <hr>This graduate seminar provides an advanced introduction to the development of modern historiography and its methods.  Focusing on the evolution of historical writing and its contribution to the pursuit of human knowledge, the course addresses the following topics:  1) the professionalization of historical research; 2) the relationship between historical understanding and the formation of critical consciousness; 3) differences in approaches to representing the past and the attendant debate about the value of historical scholarship; 4) the impact of globalization and interdisciplinary on the subject of history; and 5) the implications of the &#8220;historical turn&#8221; in the humanities and social sciences.  Students will be expected to analyze the connection between works of history and their contemporary social, political and philosophical context and to demonstrate an ability to discern and articulate the principal themes, problems and controversies which inform the field of historical study.<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> Bi-annually<br><br></div>		</td>
