<div><h3>IDCE 329 - Property and Community </h3>  <p><hr>Property is not a thing, but a social relationship&#8217;, is this course&#8217;s point of departure. Questions relevant to a &#8216;social relations theory of property&#8217; have captured attention within the social and environmental sciences. For example, what are the rights of owernship in different societies? What gives land and property its value (prestige, power and privilege). How do land tenure security and access to property shape community relations, family dynamics and/or environmental outcomes? Course readings are global and comparative in nature and examine land tenure and property relations in urban and rural contexts. Students are involved in setting some of the collective learning objectives and assignments. The course utilizes case studies and group participation to explore key themes. Students are expected to take an active part in the course through group team assignments, presentations, and working groups.</p>
