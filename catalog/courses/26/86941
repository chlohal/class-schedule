<div><h3>TA 153 - Modern Drama </h3>  <hr>This is a course designed to introduce the student to the major dramatic writers from the 19th century to the present. In studying the plays, a number of different points of view and reference will be considered including that of the playwright, the actor, the director, the historian, the dramaturge. The student is encouraged to formulate a personal opinion of these plays and dramatists. The major focus of the course is the text and the student&#8217;s understanding and interpretation of the work. However, a strong emphasis will also be placed on the performance aspect of these plays. This can take many forms, including coordination of our efforts with theatre classes on campus, field trips to theatres nearby, use of video, and even staged readings of the scripts in class. Fulfills the Verbal Expression requirement. You must have been placed at the Verbal Expression level to choose this seminar.<br><br><strong>Course Designation/Attribute:</strong> VE<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> Offered every year<br><br></div>		</td>
