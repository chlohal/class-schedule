<div><h3>IDCE 30297 - Refugees, Forced Migration, and Belonging </h3>  <p><hr>This course takes a transdisciopinary approach to investigate the practices, policies and theories that have emerged to address population displacement in its various forms, and the ways in which displaced people themselves understand and act upon their situation. The course explores the relationship between forced displacement and the nation-state, the changing nature of humanitarian emergencies in a globalizing world, and the role of diasporas in mobile place-making. The course is especially concerned with the contributions of forced migrants to development and integration. It analyzes the relationship between refugee livelihoods and urbanisation, urban development and displacement, and assesses the role of transnational networks and associations in development processes and agendas.</p>
