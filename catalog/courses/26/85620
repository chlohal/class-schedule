<div><h3>EN 101 - Environmental Science and Policy: Introductory Case Studies </h3>  <hr>This course will ignite your interest in environmental science and policy by engaging the urgent challenges of our times: conserving forests, sustaining food systems, and responding to climate change. We will ground our understanding of these complex environmental issues through case studies of New England and Ethiopia, as well as a location chosen by the class. The course integrates biophysical and social sciences with Indigenous and other place-based knowledge systems. Throughout the semester, we read classic and cutting-edge research papers, listen to podcasts, and watch short films. We engage a wide range of perspectives through discussions, small group activities, student presentations, and guest lectures. While deepening our understanding of complex environmental problems, we focus on solutions. Students learn to write policy briefs that summarize scientific knowledge and evaluate alternative policy options.<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> Annual -Fall<br><br></div>		</td>
