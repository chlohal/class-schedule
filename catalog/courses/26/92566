<div><h3>ENG 139 - Queer Literature </h3>  <p><hr>From the coded sighs of &#8220;the love that dare not speak its name&#8221; to the out and proud writers of the present moment, this course traces a non-linear history of literary engagement with queerness. &#8220;Queer,&#8221; in this context, is more than an umbrella term for LGBTQ+; it constellates a range of identities, ideas, and experiences, and it encompasses both political and aesthetic interventions. In this course, we will read works by queer authors and works that depict queer life, developing a set of queer reading practices and considering the essential questions of what it means for literature itself to be queer, and how queerness might be an element of literary form.Â </p>

<p>For undergraduate English majors, this course satisfies the Genre (C-2) requirement. This course also fulfills the Diversity and Inclusion (DI) requirement.<br><br><strong>Course Designation/Attribute:</strong> DI<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> Bi-annually<br><br></p></div>		</td>
