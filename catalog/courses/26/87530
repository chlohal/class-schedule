<div><h3>IDND 025 - Community Leadership: Building Student Engagement </h3>  <p><hr>Transitioning to a new academic community comes with great expectations, an opportunity to define your sense of self, and the chance to grapple with new ideas and to experiment with different approaches to learning. This course will explore a broad definition of leadership to prepare students for an engaged and purposeful role as members of the Clark community. Through dialogue and readings from multiple disciplines/genres, students will increase their knowledge about community values, relationships, and responsibilities. Students will be challenged to answer four questions as they transition into the Clark community: who am I; who am I as a new student at Clark; what does it take to be successful inside and outside of the classroom; and what is my role and purpose in this community? Course readings, research, and writing assignments will focus on ethical wisdom, intentional decision making, and personal values.</p>
