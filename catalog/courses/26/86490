<div><h3>MUSC 210 - Topics in Music History and Criticism </h3>  <p><hr>The Music History Seminar takes up specific topics and themes in music history that open onto larger cultural contexts and interdisciplinary lines of inquiry. The seminar is based on active discussion and student research with a depth and a focus not possible in a survey course, and will develop the student&#8217;s critical skills, as well as the ability to write and talk about music in meaningful ways. Seminar topics change each year. The course welcomes music majors and minors, as well as interested students from other disciplines. May be taken more than once for credit.  <a href="preview_course_nopop.php?catoid=26&coid=86472" onclick="acalogPopup('preview_course.php?catoid=26&coid=86472&print', '3', 770, 530, 'yes');return false;" rel="remote /ajax/preview_course.php?catoid=26&coid=86472&display_options[location]=tooltip&show" id="tt7014" target="_blank">MUSC 102</a><span style="display: none !important">&#160;</span> and/or <a href="preview_course_nopop.php?catoid=26&coid=86473" onclick="acalogPopup('preview_course.php?catoid=26&coid=86473&print', '3', 770, 530, 'yes');return false;" rel="remote /ajax/preview_course.php?catoid=26&coid=86473&display_options[location]=tooltip&show" id="tt8958" target="_blank">MUSC 104</a><span style="display: none !important">&#160;</span> are recommended, but not required.</p>

<p>Spring 2020 Topic Reflections and Repertoire</p>

<p>Reflections and Repertoire presents students with a broad survey of concert music repertoire, inciting them to discern both the obvious and subtle features of a score when rendered for performance. Students will practice the skills of critical and analytical listening, and reflect frequently about what they perceive aurally and pair these reflections with research into historical context and theoretical analysis, in order to build their own ideas about interpretation and performance.</p>

<p>The bulk of the academic work of this course leans on independent listening and theoretical analysis, which can be done individually, or collaboratively in study groups. Class lectures will provide overarching context and prompts for classwork, and class discussions facilitate group exploration of concepts and comparison of notes. Reflections and Repertoire incites students to synthesize the knowledge and skills learned through their broader musical and non-musical studies and use these to become more learned interpreters of music as a living, developing art.&#8221;</p>
