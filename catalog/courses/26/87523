<p>In this course we will examine the many ways in which behavioral analysis might aid an investigation. Crimes which exhibit psychopathology can often aid the investigator in forming an opinion about the perpetrator (profile), conducting secondary search warrants, and framing the most-productive interview strategy once the suspect is located. Behavioral techniques are also employed to detect deception in both oral and written statements and to aid prosecutions. Topics that will be explored thoroughly will include: modus operandi, <em>signature, </em>linkage and linkage blindness, organized scenes vs disorganized scenes, and victimology.</p>
