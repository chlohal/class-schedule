<div><h3>IDND 1630 - Another Way of Seeing: The World View of the Bible </h3>  <hr>We will see how a particular way of looking at God, the world and the nature of humanity emerges by tracing the historical development of the people of Israel through to the early followers of Jesus. This way of seeing will provoke thought, challenge our own presuppositions and engage us in lively conversation about the bible and its meaning. This course assumes no prior knowledge of the Bible, but will require students to interact with the biblical material by reading significant portions of it from each of its different genres. The readings, discussions and presentations will challenge students to let the Bible speak for itself and draw their own conclusions accordingly. Students will also explore areas of personal interest and share their discoveries with the class.<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> varies<br><br></div>		</td>
