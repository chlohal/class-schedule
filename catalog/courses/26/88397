<div><h3>ENG 208 - Writing the Borderlands </h3>  <hr>In this bilingual Spanish/English creative writing course, students will write poems, stories, and/or nonfiction pieces in either or both languages. We will examine several texts by Latinx authors as we consider questions of translation, code-switching, audience, and the political choices these writers make when writing in both languages. The first two-thirds of the course will focus on textual analysis, craft lessons, a translation project, and generating new writing, while the last third will be dedicated to writing workshops. The final consists of a 30-page Portfolio of revised writing. There are no language requirements, though some familiarity with Spanish will enrich your experience of the texts. This class counts as an advanced course toward the Creative Writing minor. Meets the Verbal Expression (VE) requirement. Fulfills the Diversity and Inclusion (D&amp;I) requirement.<br><br><strong>Course Designation/Attribute:</strong> VE, DI<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> Annually<br><br></div>		</td>
