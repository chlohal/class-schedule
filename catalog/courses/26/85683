<div><h3>ENG 206 - Writing the Novel </h3>  <p><hr>This course is designed for students who want to write a novel. Through careful study of published works, students will unpack the role and function of central elements of a novel - character, setting, plot, point of view, voice, etc. - and apply these techniques to their own novel through weekly writing exercises. Throughout the semester, students will write the first draft of their novel, and for their final, they will turn in a polished version of the first 10,000 words. For Creative Writing Minors, this course counts as one of the advanced courses. This course can be repeated once for credit. Students who took BOTH ENG 206 and ENG 209 prior to F&#8217;20 cannot take ENG 206 and earn credit.</p>
