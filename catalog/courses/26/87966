<div><h3>IDCE 30330 - Approaches to Community Health </h3>  <p><hr>What makes a community healthy? Why do some community members thrive, while others consistently experience health disparities?  The social determinants of health - the conditions in which people are born, live, work, play and age have significant impact on individual and population health.  Similarly, the factors that influence community health and wellness are complex and inter-related such as health literacy, availability of services, culture, and social and behavioral norms, these issues require multi-disciplinary coordinated approaches across sectors.  In this course, you will learn:</p>

<p>How to assess a community&#8217;s health and how to identify needs using evidence-based methodologies</p>

<p>How to identify and select evidence-based approaches to solve problems</p>

<p>How to empower and mobilize community members to engage in community health improvement efforts</p>

<p>Paying particular attention to vulnerable populations, we will examine challenges and barriers communities face, as well as current movements that promote social justice and health equity across a variety of current and emerging threats to community health.</p>
