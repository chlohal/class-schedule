<div><h3>HIST 318 - London and Paris: the Making of the Modern City </h3>  <hr>London and Paris are two of the great cities of the world.  This class will explore the foundation and development of these capitals as they grew from small medieval centers to the vast metropolises that they are today.  Along the way we will consider major events (the Black Death, the Reformation, the French Revolution, the World Wars); the development of urban culture and politics; and the everyday life of ordinary Londoners and Parisians.  You will hear from writers from Geoffrey Chaucer to Gertrude Stein; you will see works of art from Abbot Suger to Banksy; you will hear music from Gregorian chant to the Clash.  From the London Bridge to the Eiffel Tower, from Notre Dame to the London Eye, we will explore the making of the modern city through the stories and perspectives of these great cities.<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> Bi-annually<br><br></div>		</td>
