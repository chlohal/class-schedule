<div><h3>SOC 010 - Introduction to Sociology </h3>  <hr>A broad overview of sociology, its areas of study, modes of inquiry, and context for analysis. This course operates from the premise that individual lives are not just personal but social â€“ as humans we are shaped by the societies in which we live and the social forces at work within them. Major theoretical perspectives and concepts will be discussed, with primary emphasis on the roles that culture, dimensions of inequality, and social change play in shaping individual lives.  Students will also explore the influence that social institutions such as family, religion, education, health care, government, economy, and environment have on the ways humans live and work in society.  Fulfills introductory course requirement for majors.<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> Offered every semester<br><br></div>		</td>
