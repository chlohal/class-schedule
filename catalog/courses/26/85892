<div><h3>GEOG 324 - Economy and Environment </h3>  <hr>Environmental problems are largely the result of economic developments and human settlement patterns. This course involves the examination of different types of economies, various institutional forms and constraints, and cultural features that have environmental implications. Of particular importance are the types of futures that people envision, and the sorts of economic features that must be developed to achieve desirable (or sustainable) futures. Ecological modernization, political and social ecologies, voluntary simplicity, industrial ecology, community-based entrepreneurial economies, &#8220;other than capitalist&#8221; economies, and other discourses/practices will be examined for their economic and environmental implications. We will also consider global production networks and fair trade, third party certification, and corporate social responsibility. A practical project will be undertaken by each student. Food production and consumption will be a principal focus of the course. Open to doctoral students only.<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> Offered every other year<br><br></div>		</td>
