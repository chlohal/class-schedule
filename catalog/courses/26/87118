<div><h3>GEOG 367 - Governing Development: Institutions, Networks, Space, Place </h3>  <p><hr>This course investigates the theoretical potential and pitfalls of conceptualizing development as a field of networks of actors and institutions, and it poses the challenge of geography in understanding these networks.  More specifically, this course engages with various literatures to analyze how networks can be theorized and visualized in relation to actors such as the state, private entities, civil society and beyond. The first two thirds of the course will involve general readings on preset topics; while the last third of the course will be targeted towards the specific regional and topical interests of the student participants (each week one student will select and discuss readings of their choice).  Readings and discussions incorporate the global north as well as the global south. Questions asked include: By what mechanisms do networks and institutions operate? How do networks and institutions vary regionally (what are the structural similarities and differences)? What is the interaction between multilevel forms of governance, networked states and local institutions? What is the interaction among institutions, networks, livelihoods and resources? Open to doctoral students, but masters students may request permission to enroll.</p>
