<div><h3>GEOG 392 - Remote Sensing of Global Environmental Change </h3>  <hr>Human and natural forces are profoundly altering earth&#8217;s surface and function. This graduate-level seminar investigates how satellite remote sensing is being used to monitor and understand these changes, thus addressing many of the frontier challenges in earth system science today. Specific topics will include desertification, loss of snow and ice cover, forest disturbances, fire detection, famine early warning, boreal forest migration, carbon cycle assessments, trends in hurricane intensity, coral crises, and climate variability and change. Students will read and introduce primary and popular literatures, critically evaluate specific remote sensing applications, facilitate discussions, and debate interpretations and conclusions. Open to doctoral and masters students.<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> Offered every year.<br><br></div>		</td>
