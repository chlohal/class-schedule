<div><h3>HIST 240 - Love, Memory, and Violence: The Cultural Revolution </h3>  <p><hr>The Cultural Revolution, which ended in 1976, still impacts the Chinese society and resonates with the individuals who lived through and after the Revolution. In this course, we first survey the development of the Chinese Communist Party and examine political movements in the 1930s and 1950s to identify the roots of the Cultural Revolution. We then use different thematic lenses to</p>

<p>(re-)examine the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in the context of propaganda strategy and mass mobilization. The course uses a variety of sources including archival documents, artifacts, ephemerals, documentaries, and memoirs. They together illustrate the transformation of everyday life in communist China and how people adapt under the increasing political mobilization.</p>
