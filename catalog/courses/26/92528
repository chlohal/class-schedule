<div><h3>IDCE 305 - Innovations in Humanitarian and International Development Data </h3>  <hr>Over the last ten years, the humanitarian sector has seen a plethora of initiatives aimed at improving data collection, analysis, and the use of emerging technology to improve the way humanitarian and development interventions are carried out. The course will examine these initiatives, policies, and technologies to understand where they fit historically and functionally within a humanitarian response framework and critique their appropriateness. The course will also offer the opportunity test new technologies, workflows and design solutions. The course is a blend of seminar and lab experimentation that is open to all students. Students who view themselves as &#8220;non-technical&#8221; will learn more about the technology they will encounter in practice. If you have ever wondered about terms like &#8220;Crisis mapping&#8221;, ICT4D, innovation, crowdsourcing, or &#8220;digital humanitarians&#8221; this class is for you!<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> Annually<br><br></div>		</td>
