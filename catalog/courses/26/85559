<div><h3>ECON 297 - Honors </h3>  <hr>Students work on an individual basis with a faculty member on an intensive piece of research, culminating in an honors thesis. The honors course meets regularly in the fall semester (with regular assignments) and occasionally in the spring (when the thesis is written).  Students must register for the ECON297 course in the fall, and most students also register for a second credit in the spring (although only one credit counts towards the economics major).  Required for departmental honors. May be repeatable for credit.<br><br><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Permission of instructor.<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> Offered every year<br><br></div>		</td>
