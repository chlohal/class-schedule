<div><h3>ES 1970 - Sustainability and the Sacred </h3>  <hr>Indigenous cultures relied on three basic concepts to live sustainably: community, exchange and relationship. In this course we will experience and explore these three concepts. The interconnectedness of all life - the sacred - is the &#8220;technology&#8221; which lay at the heart of all indigenous cultures. It is all available to each of us still. Connecting to the plants, the animal kingdom, and one another as equals bring the tools we need to embrace earth changes and all that the future holds. Through this course you will be empowered to engage with Sustainability on your own terms. Please be advised that some class meetings will take place outdoors.<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> various<br><br></div>		</td>
