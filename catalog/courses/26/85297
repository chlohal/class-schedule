<div><h3>ARTS 280 - Advanced Studio in Painting and Drawing </h3>  <p><hr>This course addresses current or timely topics in the area of Studio Arts. Topics can vary from semester to semester. <em>May be repeatable for credit.</em></p>

<p><em>Students will be charged a V &amp; PA lab fee upon registering for this course.</em></p>

<p>Spring 2021 Topic: THE SPECTRUM OF ABSTRACTION</p>

<p>Just over a century ago, the first modern abstract painting was created. Despite cultural and technical developments since that time, many of the questions posed by early abstractionists still engage artists today - Can simple forms convey complex ideas and deep meaning? How does color alone influence perception? What role might this contemplative practice play in a rapidly changing world?</p>

<p>Through a series of painting and drawing assignments, students will address these issues by creating art works that examine abstraction across various movements. We will explore fauvism, abstract expressionism and minimalism, along with other historical precedents. Investigation of contemporary themes will encourage experimentation with new concepts, materials and processes. Virtual museum visits, short reading and writing assignments and dialogues will provide a critical context for these studies.  </p>

<p>Fall 2020 Topic:THE PORTRAIT: DRAWN AND PAINTED</p>

<p>The human head will be the primary focus of this studio class, but &#8220;portraiture&#8221; in a broad sense will be considered.  From Neolithic plastered skulls to today&#8217;s phone &#8220;selfie&#8221; - images of the human head are probably the most potent, frequent, symbolic, and enduring visual artifacts we create.  And for most children, a representation of the head is the very first image created.  The portrait engages mortality, celebrates the individual, reveals social mores - and fully challenges the artist.  We will look at many different examples of portraiture and examine why the portrait is such a compelling - and difficult - subject.  Students will work from life in the studio, while being encouraged to engage in more experimental interpretations of this topic outside of class.  At least one drawing or painting course is required as a prerequisite.</p>

<p>May be repeatable for credit.</p>
