<div><h3>GEOG 274 - Africa&#8217;s Development in Global Context </h3>  <hr>Explores, in detail, the economic geographies of Sub-Saharan Africa; both their historical development and their contemporary manifestations in commodity chains, business practices, production systems, gender and environmental relations, entrepreneurial and innovative behavior, and rural and urban livelihood strategies. Emphasis is placed on examining how African economies relate to the rest of the world, how globalization is influencing the prospects for growth, autonomy, and sustainability in Africa, and how Africans actually produce, innovate, succeed, and struggle in their business activities. Confronts stereotypes about &#8220;backward&#8221; economic practices in Africa and encourages students to view Africans as capable agents of economic change not simply as passive victims of global or historical inequalities.<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> Offered every other year<br><br></div>		</td>
