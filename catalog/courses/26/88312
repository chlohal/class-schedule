<div><h3>MSIT 3460 - Agile Software Development Methodology </h3>  <p><hr>Whether you work at a startup (breaking into a market) or a large corporation (attempting to maintain market share), your customers demand delivery of frequent innovations that make their user experience better and differentiate your products from the growing competition. To ensure this, organizations need to embrace a new way of developing these strategic features.</p>

<p>Continuing the project management journey, this course builds on the foundations gained in the Project Management Fundamentals course and extends them to the Lean Agile delivery methodology. By acknowledging that delivery methodologies are not &#8216;one size fits all&#8217;, we become versed in the one that meets the challenges faced by today&#8217;s technology innovators. This is the basis on which we can layer the progressive techniques found in Lean Startup and the Scaled Agile Framework.</p>

<p>As a project leader, you&#8217;ll investigate new roles, responsibilities, checkpoints (ceremonies), and metrics. Our course goals are accomplished through reading, homework assignments, in-class discussions, group presentations and an agile project simulation.</p>
