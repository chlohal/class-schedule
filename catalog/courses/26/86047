<div><h3>HIST 220 - The Black Radical Tradition </h3>  <hr>This course will explore the history of black radicalism from the founding of the nation until the end of the Civil Rights-Black Power Movement. We will read and analyze both secondary works as well as primary sources in our effort to better understand these individuals and organizations considered radical in their day. This course will pay particular attention to notions of masculinity and femininity, concepts such as black nationalism and emigrationism, and slogans like &#8220;Africa for the Africans&#8221; or &#8220;Black Power&#8221; which proved ambiguous and, to some empty. Rather than celebrate &#8220;radicalism,&#8221; and the individuals who have been popularized for taking a radical position, we will examine the consequences of positioning oneself as a radical, and taking on both those outside of a given social movement, and those within a particular social movement.<br><br><strong>Course Designation/Attribute:</strong> DI<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> Offered every other year<br><br></div>		</td>
