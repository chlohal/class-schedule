<div><h3>ENG 332 - Modernist Literature </h3>  <p><hr>Virginia Woolf famously wrote that, &#8220;on or about December 1910 human character changed.&#8221; In this class, we will test that claim, thinking about what it means to &#8220;be modern,&#8221; what it means to &#8220;be modernist,&#8221; and what the two have to do with each other. We will also consider the many meanings of &#8220;modernism,&#8221; understood variously as a literary movement that flourished within coteries like Bloomsbury, the salons of 1920&#8217;s Paris, and the Harlem Renaissance; a literary style governed by the imperative to &#8220;make it new&#8221; and an embrace of aesthetic difficulty; and the literature of the period between the two World Wars. Taking a transnational approach to the field, we will juxtapose texts from the margins of modernism with more canonical work in order to investigate modernism&#8217;s relationship with mass culture, politics, and everyday life.</p>
