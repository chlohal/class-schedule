<div><h3>CYES 290 - Praxis Design Seminar </h3>  <hr>This seminar prepares students to conceive of their activist project both in theoretical and practical terms.  Students develop drafts of portfolio pieces on the three theories of understanding that guide the CYES major: 1) a critical theory of social inequality; 2) a reflexive analysis of social and cultural identity; and 3) a theory of social change.  The conclusion of this course guides students in the development of a theoretically grounded and methodologically sound praxis project proposal, and IRB approval for their planned research.  This proposal will be read and approved by the student&#8217;s praxis project committee: the student&#8217;s major advisor (and teacher of the course), a second reader from the CYES faculty, and a community member of the committee, as the advancement to candidacy gateway.<br><br><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> This course is only for students who have declared Community, Youth, and Education Studies (CYES) as their major and are in their junior year.<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> Every Spring<br><br></div>		</td>
