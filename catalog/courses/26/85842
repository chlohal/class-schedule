<div><h3>GEOG 126 - Living in the Material World: The Political Geography of Resource Development </h3>  <hr>Focuses on consumption and production systems that determine the development, allocation and use of natural resources like water, minerals, trees and animals. Emphasizes approaches used by geographers to study natural resources (e.g., commodity chains, geopolitical analysis, ecological footprints). Case studies provide an opportunity to examine differences between societies (or economies) and between specific resource issues. Oil and gas in the Middle East and the Caspian, water in the western United States, Israel or India; gold in Tanzania, the United States and South Africa; and animal use in India, Great Britain and China are some examples of typical cases.
