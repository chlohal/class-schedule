<div><h3>ART 2130 - Landscape Issues </h3>  <hr>The grounds on campus and in surrounding areas will serve as material for studying issues in landscape drawing and composition. Issues such as color and the illusion of 3-dimensional space, the role of pespective, light and shade and the structure of landscape objects will be addressed with a variety of media. Working both indoors and out we will create compositions of both observed and imagined landscapes. The work of artists such as Van Gogh, Cezanne and John Singer Sargent will be studied to aid in the creation of our works. This course is best for those who have had some drawing or design experience.<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> varies<br><br></div>		</td>
