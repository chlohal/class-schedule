<div><h3>MUSC 119 - Hip Hop & Social Identity </h3>  <hr>Our identities come from our lived experiences. As hip hop is the expression of lived experience,it is also the expression of individual and shared identities. In this class, students will explore how hip hop, an art form originally from the Bronx, NY c. 1970, shapes and depicts various social identities. We will investigate how hip hop gives voice to an individual&#8217;s race, religion,ethnicity, gender, and sexuality. We will also question how a hip-hop artist&#8217;s self-expression intersects and merges with the identities of their listeners. A community-based learning project will allow students to both learn about and participate in their local hip hop scene of Worcester.<br><br><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Any MUSC course or MCA 101<br><br><strong>Course Designation/Attribute:</strong> DI<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> Periodically<br><br></div>		</td>
