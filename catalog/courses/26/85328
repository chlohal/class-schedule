<div><h3>BIOL 101 - Introduction to Biology I </h3>  <p><hr>The goals of the two-semester biology introductory sequence are: (1) to provide an understanding of the unifying themes in modern biology, (2) to introduce the diversity of life at all levels of organization, and (3) to illustrate the methods and modes of scientific inquiry currently used in the biological sciences. During the fall semester (BIOL 101) the focus is on fundamental principles of evolution and genetics, whereas in the spring (BIOL 102) the diversity of life, from cells to organisms, is explored. The fall and spring courses do not have to be taken in sequence but both are pre-requisites for all advanced courses in biology.</p>

The Exploratory Labs are closely aligned with the content of the Bio 101 lecture and cover a variety of topics, including evolution of defenses in fish, gene regulation, and a bioethics debate. The Semester in Research Labs are a semester-long research program focused on isolating and testing antibiotics from soil bacteria, and are a response to the global shortage of effective antibiotics. Both lab tracks provide practice in biological investigative techniques, critical thinking, and scientific communication. </span></p>
