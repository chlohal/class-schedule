<div><h3>PSYC 388 - Coping with Collective Violence and Oppression </h3>  <p><hr>This course-a combined Capstone course for Psychology majors and graduate course for doctoral students in Psychology-introduces you to different theoretical frameworks that address how people cope with collective violence and oppression, communicate about and make sense of it, and transform societal suffering through civic engagement, prosocial behavior, and resistance. The course draws on community psychology, developmental psychology, clinical psychology, and social psychology, discussing relevant theories and empirical findings from each of these fields. The contexts we examine in this course include racial oppression, genocide, war, and armed conflict-with a focus on race in the U.S., but also examples from Palestine, Northern Ireland, the aftermath of the Holocaust, Islamophobia in Europe, and several Latin American countries such as Colombia, El Salvador, and Guatemala. The final project will consist of a qualitative analysis of testimonies from the Civil Rights Movement, Holocaust, Guatemalan genocide, Rwandan genocide, or the Global Feminism project.</p>
