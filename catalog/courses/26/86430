<div><h3>MGMT 5543 - Project Management </h3>  <p><hr>For some time, management experts such as Tom Peters in The Wow Project have been predicting that &#8216;white collar&#8217; work will become more and more project-based. This trend is clear in many professions and industries including accounting, architecture, construction, consulting, implementation of mergers and acquisitions, law, new product introduction, etc. Individuals and managers in &#8216;operational&#8217; positions are being challenged to do more; i.e., take on and manage a project to drive innovation in the organization.</p>

<p><br>
The course will cover tools and techniques necessary for successful management and completion of projects. Students will learn about project management concepts, challenges, needs identification, proposed solutions, risk assessment/management, project planning, scheduling, project control techniques, project team management, communication, change management responsibilities, documentation and web-based project management software. In addition, project management as a possible career path will be discussed.<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> Varies<br><br></p></div>		</td>
