<div><h3>PSYC 381 - Understanding and Addressing Mental Healthcare Disparities in the U.S. </h3>  <p><hr>This course will provide students with an overview of the persistent disparities in access to, and engagement with, mental healthcare in the U.S. We will review the research that has found disparities with different populations and across numerous mental disorders, as well as consider why existing knowledge has not led to a reduction in these disparities. We will then consider a range of possible solutions that encompass greater attention to sociocultural factors. Students will be exposed to a combination of theoretical perspectives, practical issues, and experiential activities.</p>
