<div><h3>MPA 3590 - Global Health </h3>  <hr>This is a survey course designed to introduce the concepts of global health, the burden of disease, and the social determinants that drive health outcomes. Many NGOs and other organizations work around the world on health-related issues, yet few are truly successful. This course will challenge students to critically analyze the current approaches to global health and engagement. Topics such as maternal and child health, HIV/AIDS, and the effects of war and conflict will be covered. This course focuses primarily on developing countries and includes an overview of cultural norms and political implications of health provision. The course will take place in the classroom as well as on Moodle.<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> varied<br><br></div>		</td>
