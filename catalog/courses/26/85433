<div><h3>CHEM 289 - Research Methods </h3>  <p><hr>Deals with the application of analytical tools widely used in the laboratory. Topics include NMR, EPR, IR, Raman, UV-visible, mass and fluorescence spectroscopy, chromatography, electrophoresis, electrochemistry and other techniques. Emphasizes practical knowledge for data interpretation and instrument operation. Quarter-credit courses lasting four to five weeks are offered periodically. Graded as Pass/Fail. May be repeatable for credit.</p>

<p><strong>FALL 2020 Topic:SCIENTIFIC WRITING AND COMMUNICATIONS:</strong> Being able to clearly and effectively communicate scientific and technical information is a skill that is critically important for both academics and professionals. With a focus on practical topics, such as writing research proposals, creating figures and posters to illustrate data, and presenting research results, this interactive course helps science students to develop the skills of written, graphic, and oral communication. A major emphasis is place on revising documents to better organize their content, which makes it easier for the reader to receive and understand the main messages. A second focus is using effective grammar and graphic design to polish documents into excellent final products.</p>

<p><strong>SPRING 2021 TOPIC - HPLC &amp; MASS SPECTROMETRY - </strong>This quarter unit course is a practical, hands-on introduction to using chromatography instruments such as high performance liquid chromatography, liquid chromatography / mass spectrometry, and gas chromatography / mass spectrometry instruments. These methods are widely used throughout both academic and industrial research settings for separating synthetic and biomolecular compounds. The course is intended for graduate students and research active undergraduates in the natural science departments.</p>

<p><strong>SPRING 2021 Topic: EXPRESSION, PURIFICATION &amp; ANALYSIS OF PROTEINS: A PROJECT-BASED LEARNING EXPERIENCE</strong>: Through lecture, discussion and homework and labs, each student will become familiar with key approaches in expression, purification, and analysis of proteins from overexpression systems. Students will understand how a system of expression, bacterial or eukaryotic, is chosen for a protein expression. We shall focus of expression of recombinant KRAS protein in E. coli. Students will learn about standard techniques like DNA miniprep, PCR and Site-directed mutagenesis. Students will learn about different approaches of protein purification including different types of liquid chromatography. Students will also be introduced to common approaches for characterization of proteins including binding assays; activity assays; mass spectroscopy to identify protein.</p>

<p>In addition, students will also do the following hands-on training:</p>

<ul>
	<li>check gene corresponding to target protein from plasmid.</li>
	<li>Design primers for site-directed mutagenesis of KRAS recombinant protein.</li>
	<li>do bacterial culture on a small scale and experience how different conditions affect protein expression.</li>
	<li>(If time permits) KRASB mutant protein purification using affinity chromatography.</li>
</ul>
