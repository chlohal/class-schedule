<div><h3>MUSC 102 - Music of the Classical and Romantic Periods </h3>  <hr>This course explores European music from the mid-18th century through the end of the 19th century. This era was in many ways a high point in the history of musical art and many of the greatest and most beloved composers were active during this time, including Haydn, Mozart, Beethoven, Schubert, Berlioz, Chopin, Verdi, Wagner, Brahms and Mahler. Through a mix of listening, reading, discussion and various written assignments, students will develop an understanding of representative works by these composers, build a sense of the social and cultural contexts in which they worked, as well as sharpen their aesthetic appreciation of this music. Previous musical experience is helpful, but not required.<br><br><strong>Course Designation/Attribute:</strong> AP<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> Offered every year<br><br></div>		</td>
