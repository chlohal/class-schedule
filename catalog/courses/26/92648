<div><h3>ARTS 104 - Creative Diet: A Six-Week Challenge </h3>  <hr>This course is outside of a &#8220;normal&#8221; drawing class in that the focus of this course is entirely in creating with thought-provoking restrictions inside the confines of a sketchbook. Questions about what a sketchbook is, its role in a daily practice, restrictions, contingencies and play with materials will be explored. Creative prompts will lead conceptual issues and the inter-relatedness of the media. Within the pages, a new side of one&#8217;s work can open up and content can arise out of process. Image lectures and viewing of works online will be presented to discuss sketchbooks in terms of contemporary issues, process and content.<br>
Over the course, you will receive creative prompts, after which you will create in your sketchbook as a response to the prompt. Using traditional and non-traditional art materials, you will expand the borders of the sketchbook page with creative visual responses.<br><br><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> ARTS 102 Drawing Eye Mind Hand is strongly recommended.<br><br><strong>Course Designation/Attribute:</strong> AP<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> Bi-annually<br><br></div>		</td>
