<div><h3>ID 203 - Youth Work: Practice and Social Justice </h3>  <p><hr>This course will advance the theory and practice of community-based youth work. Given the current challenges facing public schools, labor markets, and local governments, non-profit community-based youth organizations become important actors in youth development. This course will focus on six case studies about everyday dilemmas facing youth workers. It will situate each dilemma into its broader context (e.g. family, peer, school, neighborhood, juvenile justice, policy, and media, etc.). Literature will be used to understand the generalizability of the dilemma; to build understanding as to how the cases illustrate larger social problems; and to create a youth worker professional education opportunity. Community-based youth workers will also be participants in the class and each Clark student who is not already engaged with a youth serving organizations on a regular basis will be paired with a Youth Worker in the class for a community based learning opportunity for a minimum of 5 hours a week.  Student learning outcomes include:  how to explore and build your knowledge, skills, and attitudes about youth work; how to frame and resolve ill-defined problems; how to think  and communicate on one&#8217;s feet; and to enhance content knowledge on youth development theories, research, and strategies.</p>
