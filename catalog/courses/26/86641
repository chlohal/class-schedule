<div><h3>PSCI 226 - International Political Economy </h3>  <hr>Focuses on political determinants of international trade and finance, and to a lesser extent, it is also about the economic determinants of international politics. In this course, we will learn how the international economic system has evolved and examine how we arrived at this pivotal juncture called the &#8220;global political economy.&#8221; We will study how the international political mechanism and historical forces led to the acceptance of certain economic models, theories and ideas. Particularly, the focus will be on actual international economic processes, their inner workings and interlinkages. We will analyze how domestic political alignments influence a country&#8217;s trade and tariff policies. Why do some countries make decisions that seem to defy conventional economic logic? Why do some countries choose to trade more and why do some countries choose to restrict international trade? More importantly, in this course we will try and unravel the mysteries behind the &#8220;international market system.&#8221; How does it work? And what are its benefits and consequences?<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> Offered periodically<br><br></div>		</td>
