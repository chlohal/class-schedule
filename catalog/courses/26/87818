<p><strong>MSPC 3440-01 COMMUNICATION AND SOCIAL MEDIA IN A RAPIDLY CHANGING WORLD  </strong>We live in unprecedented times. Everything has changed, yet we need to figure out how to move forward despite economic and social uncertainty. This course will introduce you to the theories and practices of contemporary communications and social media, and bolster your knowledge, skills and abilities in both areas. Topics will include: effective communication, written, oral and digital communication, the power of persuasion, social media, and podcasting. Students will have an opportunity to practice their oral communication skills and - if possible &#8211; engage in a community-based project to help 1-2 local nonprofits improve their communications program.</p>

<p><strong>MSPC 3440-02 ETHICS IN THE DIGITAL WORLD  </strong>This course presents ethical dilemmas in digital marketing and works through the implications of various actions, such as tricking search engines (typically called &#8220;black hat&#8221; techniques), posing as customers in social media, making false or exaggerated claims, and using questionable or sneaky channels (e.g. pop-ups and plug-ins).  In this course, we will explore several issues or concepts in depth, first introducing the facetsand aspects of the topic, then utilizing that knowledge to develop our principles and values<br>
through dialogue and the examination of multiple perspectives.</p>

<p><strong>MSPC 3440-03 SOCIAL AND EMOTIONAL INTELLIGENCE AT WORK  </strong>With employers looking for leaders and team members who can effectively connect, communicate, and collaborate, it is important to pay attention to the social emotional component of the workplace.  This course will offer participants the opportunity to identify key characteristics of emotional intelligence and how to leverage these understandings in the workplace as a leader or a member of a team.  As well, we will explore how to integrate opportunities for social emotional learning by examining current practices in the field of education and business.  </p>

<p><u>Fall 2020</u>:</p>

<p><strong>MSPC 3440-01 EFFECTIVE SPEAKING  </strong>This experiential learning course introduces the principles of effective speaking that will allow students to increase their effectiveness in a wide range of public and social settings. Whether we&#8217;re talking in a team meeting or presenting in front of an audience, we have to speak in public from time to time. Being a good public speaker can enhance your reputation, boost your self-confidence, and open up countless career opportunities. Topics covered in this course include preparation, content selection and organization, audience analysis, delivery techniques, reducing clutter, use of technology, non-verbal communication analysis and the use of visuals.</p>

<p><strong>MSPC 3440-02 CORPORATE COMMUNICATIONS  </strong>This course provides a comprehensive introduction to corporate communications and public relations. Corporations increasingly need communication to survive, as they need to build and maintain relations with a variety of stakeholders to prosper. This includes actors external to the organization - customers, governments and civil society organizations - but also stakeholders within corporations themselves, such as employees, managers and investors. Corporate communication can be characterized as both a field of academic inquiry and a practice. Students will develop both an understanding and a practical application of corporate communications.</p>
