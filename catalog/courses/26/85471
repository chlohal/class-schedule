<div><h3>CMLT 132 - Sexuality and Textuality </h3>  <hr>The course serves as an introduction to gay and lesbian studies and queer theory from the perspective of literature in an international and intercultural context. We will read ancient Greek texts, as well as literary works by authors such as Gide, Mann, Mishima and Puig and theoretical works by thinkers such as Foucault and Butler. The course asks both how the sexuality of a writer expresses itself in his or her writings, but also how rhetoric and language themselves inform sexuality in a variety of cultural contexts.<br><br><strong>Course Designation/Attribute:</strong> DI, GP<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> Offered periodically<br><br></div>		</td>
