<div><h3>GEOG 323 - Forest Ecology and Management Seminar </h3>  <hr>Forests are among the most important ecosystems on Earth. The interacting effects of climate change, increased settlement in forests, and other forces has led to difficult questions regarding what is actually driving change in forest ecosystems and what management strategies are most appropriate. In this context, the seminar examines current primary literature dealing with forest ecology and management and focuses on conducting research in forest ecosystems and deriving appropriate management recommendations from that research. Open to doctoral and masters students.<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> Offered every other year<br><br></div>		</td>
