<div><h3>PSYC 240 - Race and Racism: Theory and Experiences </h3>  <p><hr>This course addresses the historical and sociopolitical construction of the concept of race and racial categories, and the ways in which &#8216;race&#8217; shapes our social world. Using Critical Race Theory, we focus on social inequality and on the importance of approaching racism as a systemic phenomenon that structures societies at all levels and in all domains. The objectives of the course are to provide students with a critical and theoretical appreciation of the historical construction of &#8216;race&#8217; and of its functioning in the social world, and to lead them to use this perspective as an analytic tool for understanding the world around them, for examining how their own identity in this racialized social world has shaped their experience, and for understanding the experiences of people from &#8216;racial&#8217; groups different from their own. Readings, films, class activities, and assignments are designed to promote these objectives and to stimulate students&#8217; reflections about the role they want to play as social agents.</p>
