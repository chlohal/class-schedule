<div><h3>PSYC 377 - Masculinities and Violence </h3>  <hr>This capstone seminar will focus on how masculinities interact with several forms of human violence. The course will begin with an examination of sociocultural and evolutionary theories of gender and masculinity, and we will debate the strengths and weakness of different perspectives. Each subsequent week will focus on a different form of human violence, including homicide, sexual assault, war and terrorism, bullying, sports, and others. The primary task of our discussions will be to examine how different forms of masculinity provoke, attenuate, or respond to human violence. Although our primary focus will be on understanding human violence, we will also examine efforts and solutions to reducing or eliminating violence (e.g., sexual assault prevention, suicide prevention, and pacifism). This seminar will be discussion based, interspersed with mini-lectures, activities, and media presentations. Students will also work toward developing a theoretically-grounded anti-violence intervention throughout the semester.<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> Bi-annually<br><br></div>		</td>
