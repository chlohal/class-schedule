<div><h3>MSPC 3940 - Internship </h3>  <hr>Students secure placement in internships that complement their academic pursuits. Internships may be without pay or may pay a salary or stipend. Tasks assigned during an internship are expected to involve a balance of needed clerical work and challenging responsibilities allowing professional growth, with a time commitment of 20 hours per week. Interns report to a designated on-site supervisor who provides guidance and feedback on performance. Both the intern and the on-site supervisor interface with the academic coordinator to assure smooth progress during the semester. Periodic on-campus seminars with the academic supervisor provide an arena for feedback on issues common to all the interns; the academic coordinator also provides a wider perspective on concerns at individual internship sites. The internship is strongly encouraged for all students with fewer than three years full-time professional work experience.<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> every semester<br><br></div>		</td>
