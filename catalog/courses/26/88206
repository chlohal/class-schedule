<div><h3>CJ 1620 - Criminal Investigations </h3>  <hr>The art and science of criminal investigations has advanced considerably over the past decade. New tools, methods and technologies are now part of a successful investigation. Areas of study include the fourth amendment to the Constitution, rights of individuals regarding search and seizure, interview and interrogation techniques, search methods, and the collection and preservation of evidence. We will also look at the modus operandi system, scientific aids and electronic information gathering systems. As all evidence that is found at a crime scene must be documented and reported we will also practice the basics of technical report writing as it applies to criminal investigations.<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> Varies<br><br></div>		</td>
