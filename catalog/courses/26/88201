<div><h3>HS 100 - Symposium Seminar </h3>  <hr><span style="font-family:'times new roman', serif;font-size:11pt;">Students will explore the Higgins School&#8217;s symposium theme in-depth through event attendance, readings and screenings, in-class discussions, and short written assignments. While the symposium program is interdisciplinary by nature, the section instructor will draw particularly from their areas of specialization. This half-unit course may be added to a standard four-course load without fifth course approval, is offered on a &#8220;pass/fail&#8221; grading basis, and may be repeatable for credit. As with other Higgins School courses, this class is designed to help students to strengthen and enhance their college experience and to forge connections across and beyond conventional coursework.</span><br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> Most semesters<br><br></div>		</td>
