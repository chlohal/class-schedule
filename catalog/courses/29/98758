<div><h3>SOC 225 - Religion and Society </h3>  <hr>This course introduces students to key theoretical and empirical works in the sociology of religion. We apply major theoretical perspectives to contemporary religious life. We ask how individuals find meaning in and are shaped by their experience of religion. Special consideration is given to how gender, sexuality, race, and ethnicity influence religious life. We explore the rise of new religious movements (historical and contemporary), the relationship between religion and modernity, and between religious fundamentalism and conservatism.<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> occasionally<br><br></div>		</td>
