<div><h3>HIST 246 - The French Revolution, Napoleon, and the Foundations of Modernity </h3>  <hr>The quarter century separating the storming of the Bastille (1789) and Napoleon&#8217;s defeat at Waterloo (1815) constitutes one of the main watersheds in history. During these years, the French ended a regime based on privilege, abolished the monarchy, introduced human rights, and experimented with a political process based on frequent elections. On the other hand, new leaders introduced novel forms of antidemocratic policies, invaded numerous countries, and were involved in a bloody civil war. At once liberating and exploitative, the French revolution and Napoleon&#8217;s regime era had a profound influence on all of Europe and beyond.<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> Bi-annually<br><br></div>		</td>
