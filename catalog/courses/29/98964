<div><h3>MPA 3999 - Capstone Practicum </h3>  <p><hr>Integrates the course work of the MPA program into a comprehensive application. While in teams, under the supervision of a faculty instructor, students address an actual challenge faced by an organization of a department within an organization. Students study the issues, review industry trends, research the depth of the issue, and make a series of recommendations to key members of an organization. The practicum culminates in a formal written and oral presentation of the team&#8217;s work, which is evaluated by faculty and organizational professionals. Students should take the Capstone course near the end of their graduate program (at least after two full semesters in the program).  To register, students must seek permission from their academic advisor.  This course may be repeated for credit by the Senior Leadership Program Cohort who will be taking this course at .5 units.</p>

<p>Students schedules will be accommodated.</p>
