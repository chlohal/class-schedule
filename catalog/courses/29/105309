<div><h3>ARAB 102 - Elementary Arabic II </h3>  <hr>This course is designed to help students move from the beginning level of proficiency, which centers on daily life and their immediate world, to the intermediate and high intermediate level toward the end, which broaden to include topics of general and professional interest. The materials revolve around a story about a set of characters and focus on vocabulary activation and developing speaking, listening and reading comprehension, and writing and cultural skills. Also, they are structured with exercises to be done before class and activities to be done in class. The chapters starts with extensive work on vocabulary acquisition and activation. After, students are prepared for the story, which is followed by focused grammar work. The cultural, the reading and the listening sections and their activities, along with their speaking and writing activities, appear later in the chapters as they are designed to push the students to expand their skills and use their vocabulary in new contexts. The materials offers a choice between Egyptian and Levantine dialect. In other words, teaching spoken forms results in an enhanced fluency that transfers to formal Arabic as well. Teaching with this approach and these materials, students will reach solid intermediate proficiency in all skills by the end of the semester. <br><br><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> <a href="preview_course_nopop.php?catoid=29&coid=105209" onclick="acalogPopup('preview_course.php?catoid=29&coid=105209&print', '3', 770, 530, 'yes');return false;" rel="remote /ajax/preview_course.php?catoid=29&coid=105209&display_options[location]=tooltip&show" id="tt8019" target="_blank">ARAB 101</a><span style="display: none !important">&#160;</span> <br><br><strong>Course Designation/Attribute:</strong> LP<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> Every spring semester<br><br><div style="display: none; z-index: 1000;" class="tooltip for_tt8019"></div></div>		</td>
