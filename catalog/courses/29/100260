The class will operate as a mini-newsroom, meeting weekly and developing story ideas on issues proposed by students or the instructor. A key element is that the projects and storytelling modalities will be selected by students and developed with professional guidance. The storytelling modalities will depend on each student&#8217;s interests, and include writing, photography, podcasts, and video documentary forms. Students will have the opportunity to work in teams on a project as well as alone, depending on the type of story. Students will have the opportunity to submit their work for publication in professional media and participate in the annual convention workshops of the New England Newspaper &amp; Press Association. The course will also provide each student a portfolio of work for pursuing internship and employment opportunities.<br><br><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> MSPC 3216 Journalism in an Age of Social Media, MSPC 3218 Brand Journalism, or Instructor Permission<br><br><strong>Course Designation/Attribute:</strong> N/A<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> varies<br><br></div>		</td>
