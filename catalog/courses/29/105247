<div><h3>PSYC 351 - Theories of Human Development </h3>  <hr>This course addresses several theoretical issues of particular relevance to developmental science and a variety of theoretical frameworks for understanding human development. We will also cover several classical and contemporary theoretical frameworks for understanding development, including Freud&#8217;s theory, Erikson&#8217;s theory, Piaget&#8217;s developmental theory, Vygotsky&#8217;s sociocultural theory, dynamic systems theory, ecological systems theory, and whether and how racialized process and intersectionality have been considered in developmental theorizing. The goals of the course are to position you to not only understand and evaluate different approaches to development, but also to provide you with the tools to critically reflect on the assumptions underlying developmental research and how theoretical frameworks have influenced developmental practice.<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> Periodically<br><br></div>		</td>
