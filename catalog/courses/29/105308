<div><h3>IDND 075 - Building Success in (& Despite) Academia </h3>  <hr>What is academic success and how do we achieve it? This course critically analyzes the concept of success in academia while also providing tangible strategies and practices that can be implemented to allow students to achieve their academic goals. Through a variety of readings, activities, and discussions, we will explore learning theory, ways of knowing, and individual strategies for navigating academia and academic requirements. We will move beyond individual responsibility to critique the many overlapping systems that create barriers to success and re-imagine how communities can support all learners in being successful in and beyond their college career.<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> every semester<br><br></div>		</td>
