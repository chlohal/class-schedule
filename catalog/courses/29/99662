<div><h3>EDUC 355 - Curriculum and Knowing: Humanities </h3>  <hr>Participants in this week-long summer institute will read, discuss, and respond to literature written for adults, adolescents and children, with a focus on thematic connections and author&#8217;s craft. Through a range of active engagements with literature, readings of professional articles, reflective, responsive, and creative writing, we will read and discuss text sets organized by author, genre and theme. Past participants in the Humanities Institute will share their strategies for using diverse modes of responding to literature in classrooms at the elementary, middle, and secondary levels.Â  Participants will complete literature-based curriculum units in their own classrooms in the fall and reconvene in October to share their work.<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> Summer<br><br></div>		</td>
