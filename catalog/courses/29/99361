<p>Media literacy is the ability to think critically about what you are seeing, reading, and hearing. It helps us to analyze information from a variety of viewpoints. With so many sources of news, media and information today, critical thinking skills can help people and organizational leaders identify reliable sources and filter through the noise to get at facts that are accurate and reliable.
