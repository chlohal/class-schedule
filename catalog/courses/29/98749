<div><h3>ENG 164 - The Gothic </h3>  <hr><span style="color:rgb(54,54,53);font-family:verdana, sans-serif;">The Gothic, one of the most popular genres in nineteenth-century Britain, explores the dominant culture through its dark underside. In detailing both individual and national transgressions, this literature responds to significant cultural movements of the time, such as the advent of psychology and the explosion of revolutionary politics. This course traces Gothic literature from its origins in representations of fear and pain to its culmination in portrayals of alienation and monstrosity. To fully understand the genre, we will read a wide range of authors including Mary Shelley, Bram Stoker and Robert Louis Stevenson, as well as critical literature on eighteenth- and nineteenth-century theories of psychology and politics. For English majors, this course satisfies the C-2 requirement.</span><br><br><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> VE<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> Periodically<br><br></div>		</td>
