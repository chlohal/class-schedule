<div><h3>GAME 242 - Interactive Theater </h3>  <p><hr>This course culminates in the production and performance of a non-linear, participatory, and interactive theatre work. Unique to this course is its multi-disciplinary exploration, critical analysis, and application of innovative forms of theatre production which will marry traditional approaches such as scripted dialogue, physical set design, costume production, and audio mixing, with techniques commonly found in game and interactive media. Techniques unique to this project include the creation of an interaction guide, avatar design, 3D modeling and visualization, and interdisciplinary audio design. Production will be broken into four key sectors: 1. writing/scripting/interaction design 2. character/avatar building and costuming 3. set/visualization and prop design 4. audio design and execution. Each member of the course is expected to identify and join two of the four sectors.</p>
