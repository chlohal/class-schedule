<div><h3>ENG 2770 - 21st Century Ethnic American Literature </h3>  <hr>Our focus in this course is a study of ethnic American literature from the 21st century. Each week is broken down into a theme: Home, Heritage, Language, Crossing, and Americans. Through these lenses, students will investigate readings by Asian American, African American, Native American, and Hispanic American authors. With the weekly writing assignments, students will develop their ideas about the literature, forming critical analyses of the works. By the end of this course, students will not only be more well read in the ethnic American literature canon, but they will also be well-versed in the important political, social, and historical contexts of those works. As this is a course that will emphasize the intersections between race, gender, sexuality, and class, students will also be able to recognize and articulate trends in contemporary literature, politics, media, and society that exist in American literature.<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> varies<br><br></div>		</td>
