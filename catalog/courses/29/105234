<div><h3>HIST 2400 - Special Topics </h3>  <p><hr>This course addresses current or timely topics (in History) that are in a pilot phase or are known to be one-time offerings.  Special Topics can vary from semester to semester. May be repeated for credit if the topic is different.</p>

<p>SUMMER 2022:Witches, Prostitutes and Pirates in the Atlantic World, 1600-1800</p>

<p>The Early Modern Atlantic is generally seen as an intellectual space, a place where letters and books and ideas flowed from one side of the ocean to another. In this course we will pull back the veneer of respectability and look at the people on the margins of the societies of the Atlantic. In exploring the lives of the marginalized - how they lived, and the evidence of their lives - we can better understand the nature of the cross-cultural exchanges that characterize this historical space.</p>
