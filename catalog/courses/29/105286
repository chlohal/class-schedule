<div><h3>ID 072 - Navigating the Climate Crisis </h3>  <p><hr>The climate crisis is arguably one of the most pressing issues facing life on Earth today. It is both far away and local, it is in the future but also immediate, its impacts are inevitable, but opportunities are hopeful. This course surveys the climate crisis - its impacts and opportunities for life on Earth now and in the future. We learn about basic climate change science, international and local political governance that drives the state of climate knowledge, and intersections with climate change: energy transitions, urban and rural resilience, biodiversity, conservation, and environmental and social justice. We will also explore local issues of climate change and grassroots responses to ensure local climate resilience, sustainability, and justice.</p>

<p>Students will be introduced to the physical, political, economic, and social aspects of climate change and its interactions with different human and non-human actors across space and time. Students will have the opportunity to learn about specific regions and places disproportionately impacted by climate change, to understand what socio-environmental processes link them, as well as consider distinct case studies. This is a Collaborative Course with A new Earth conversation (NEC), a campus-wide climate education initiative at Clark University.<br><br><strong>Course Designation/Attribute:</strong> GP<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> Bi-Annually<br><br></p></div>		</td>
