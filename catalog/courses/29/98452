<div><h3>PSYC 386 - Advanced Topics in Developmental Psychology </h3>  <p><hr>This capstone seminar provides students the opportunity to consider how to link theory and research in developmental psychology to authentic problems and issues. Students will be involved in a project working with a local organization, as well as have the opportunity to link the study of human development to areas of personal interest.</p>

<p><strong>FALL 2022: BODY IMAGE, CULTURE AND MEDIA</strong></p>

<p>This capstone seminar will address the complex interplay of biological, psychological, and socio-cultural factors that influence the development of body image and eating attitudes. The class will explore important theories, perspectives, and concepts for understanding the development of body image, and eating attitudes. We will specifically investigate cultural influences reflected in the media such as social media, television, movies, cartoons, magazines, video games, and the news. Students will view media content, be introduced to relevant text and research to analyze the link between body image, eating attitudes, culture, and media. Students will gain increased understanding as to what reinforces the ideal body image as well as what contributes to body dissatisfaction, examining the role gender, sexuality, social class, age, and ethnicity has on body satisfaction and how/why differences arise.Â </p>

<p><strong>SPRING 2023: ADVANCED RESEARCH METHODS IN DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY</strong></p>

<p>This course focuses on design and research methods used in the study of developmental psychology. We will discuss classic, current, and future methodological methods, applied to investigate developmental questions. We will also discuss an overview of statistical approaches used in the field as well as research design. In this class, you will learn how to evaluate the appropriateness of different methodological and statistical approaches to address your theory and empirical informed research question. Course materials will focus on the conceptual, design, and analytic issues to research across development. This course is designed to provide students with the knowledge, skills, and understanding to both conduct and evaluate research in developmental psychology.</p>
