<div><h3>MGMT 260 - Applying the Art and Science of Management (Capstone) </h3>  <hr>Applying the art and science of management  focuses on the actions and decisions of senior and middle level managers in different types and sizes of organizations.  Strategic decisions at these levels consider all aspects of the organization, both internal and external.  These decisions are being made in a complex environment of economic, social, environmental, political, and legal forces, all affecting the total enterprise. They also occur with pressures of competition from other organizations operating in the same industry.
