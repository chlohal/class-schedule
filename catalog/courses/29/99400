<div><h3>IDCE 30309 - Research Practicum: Health, Communities, and the Environment </h3>  <hr>This course is a substitute for the individual Masters Final Project course IDCE30213 when the student is working as part of a larger project team. The course is designed to coordinate, guide and implement team project research efforts that are new or ongoing in the Health and Environment IDCE Signature domain. Each student has a specific task and role in the larger team effort, and her/his efforts make a significant contribution to the success of the larger project.  The course supports - and is supported by - the ongoing Holliston Health (H2). Project H2 is a multi-dimensional project that draws from environmental science and policy, epidemiology, GIS, hydrology, water engineering, political and social networks, and health anthropology.  Students can take the course for 0.5 or 1.0 course credit (as they could with IDCE30213).  Students not only learn how to develop their own research focus/questions in the context of the larger research goals, they learn mixed methods for data gathering and processing, as well as valuable team-project collaborative learning that is highly sought-after professionally.<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> annually<br><br></div>		</td>
