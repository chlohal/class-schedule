<div><h3>MUSC 001 - Key Board Skills </h3>  <hr>This Keyboard Skills course focuses on developing foundational keyboard proficiency. The skills built in this class will provide students with musicianship skills that will help them in every other aspect of the music curriculum. Students will learn to play scales, chords, arpeggios in major &amp; minor key signatures, perform fundamental piano repertoire and engage in various improvisation exercises and chord progression exercises. Developing music literacy through piano playing is a key aspect of this class. Other aspects we will focus on are posture at the instrument, understanding the benefits of fingerings for passagework, and other issues of body mechanics that contribute to painfree performance.<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> Offered every semester<br><br></div>		</td>
