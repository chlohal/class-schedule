Under the supervision of a faculty instructor, students address an actual challenge faced by an organization or a department within an organization. Students study the issues, review industry trends, research the depth of the issue, and make a series of recommendations to key members of an organization. The capstone culminates in a formal written and oral presentation of the student&#8217;s work, which is evaluated by faculty and organization professionals. (Course should be taken in student&#8217;s last semester.Â  Instructor/Program Permission is required.)<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> Varied<br><br></div>		</td>
