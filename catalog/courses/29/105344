<h5>SPRING 2023 MSPM3440-02 OPERATIONS MANANGEMENT WITH LEAN&#8211;</h5>

<p>The Lean Organization has its roots in manufacturing and infrastructure. Beginning with Toyota&#8217;s revolutionary &#8220;TQM&#8221; (Total Quality Management) in the 1950s, a new way of designing systems emerged. The bedrock of all of these disciplines is the elimination of waste and the focus on value-add delivery. In this course we will dig in deep to master the fundamentals and then expand on that learning to incorporate the ground-breaking developments that came later.</p>

<p>Adopting Lean requires a deep, and sustained systemic change to an organization. Knowledgeable change leaders must be in place to organize, measure, and support this transformation. Through this course we will introduce the students to the theories, practices, and modern tools necessary to successfully implement a lean model.<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> Varied<br><br></p></div>		</td>
