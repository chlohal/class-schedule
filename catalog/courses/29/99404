<div><h3>ID 133 - Gender and Refugee Issues in International Development </h3>  <hr>Conflict and natural disasters have displaced more than 55 million people worldwide. Many displaced persons are refugees who have crossed an international border, while others are internally displaced within their own political borders. Are there gendered effects of displacement? How are the needs of women, children, the disabled, LBGTQI populations taken into consideration across the refugee cycle (from displacement until the return &#8216;home&#8217;)? Does displacement alter traditional social norms that usually constrain behavior and provide opportunities for men and women to take on new roles and responsibilities? We will seek to answer such questions by untangling the nexus of displacement, gender, refugees and resettlement. Through readings, film, lectures, country-focused case studies, and writing assignments students will explore the gendered dimensions of post-conflict and post-disaster resettlement programs. Students will have the opportunity to strengthen their critical thinking, presentation and writing skills through close reading, in-class discussions, take-home examinations.<br><br><strong>Course Designation/Attribute:</strong> GP<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> Varies<br><br></div>		</td>
