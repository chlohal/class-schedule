<div><h3>PHIL 254 - Women Philosophers in the Early Modern Period </h3>  <p><hr>Why are there no women in my textbook on early modern European philosophy? Descartes, Leibniz, Kant&#8230; it is likely that somebody pointing us to an example of an early modern philosopher will point us to a man. In this class we will read texts by female writers of the period and discuss their answers to some of the following questions: what makes something a law of nature? is space absolute or relative? how does the mind relate to the body? how should women be educated? and what are women&#8217;s rights? We will think about the role these women&#8217;s positions and arguments played in the philosophical debate of the time.</p>

<p><br>
Besides engaging with these writers in detail, we will also step back to ask background questions about practices in teaching and research. We will think about how it is that a work becomes part of a canon of works that is taught in college classes and/or discussed in the scholarship. And we will reflect on the reasons for why women have been largely absent from what is regarded as the standard early modern canon.<br><br><strong>Course Designation/Attribute:</strong> DI<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> Fall or Spring<br><br></p></div>		</td>
