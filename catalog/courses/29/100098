<div><h3>HGS 325 - Genocide Prevention and Conflict Transformation </h3>  <hr>The prevention of genocide can be framed as a paradox: by the time it is seen it is often too late to prevent. This course will interrogate this paradox by examining global case studies and theories around broader conflict prevention, focusing on transformation. A range of issues involved in prevention will be addressed through considering international, state, and local mechanisms and practices. Additional themes include: the problem of political will, the dynamics of &#8220;global&#8221; anti-genocide activism, resiliency as survival, possibilities for peacebuilding, and non-competitive memory. Various theory and practice experts will be consulted through a wide range of both social science and policy readings. Learners will get to hear from activists and prevention workers on the ground who are building anti-genocide protections into societies. The course is reading and research intensive, offering learners an opportunity to engage in a group research project around the dynamics and mechanisms of prevention.<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> Bi-Annually<br><br></div>		</td>
