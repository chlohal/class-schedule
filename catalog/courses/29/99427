<div><h3>PSYC 358 - Stereotypes and Prejudice </h3>  <hr>This graduate level course provides an introduction to the social psychology of stereotypes and<br>
prejudice. Students will explore a variety of topics regarding stereotypes and prejudice,<br>
including cognitive processing (e.g., categorization, activation, application), content and<br>
structure, expression, sociostructural causes and consequences (e.g., power, status, threat), and<br>
their reduction or elimination (e.g., prejudice reduction, intergroup interactions, social change).<br>
Further, students will engage both theoretical and metatheoretical debates in the field of<br>
stereotypes and prejudice and will develop a critical approach to assessing empirical research.<br>
The goals of this course are to (1) provide students with an in-depth understanding of<br>
stereotypes and prejudice and how they affect social and political reality, (2) critically examine<br>
theory and metatheory guiding research on stereotypes and prejudice, (3) learn how researchers<br>
study stereotypes and prejudice, and (4) develop a research proposal or review paper.<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> Fall or Spring<br><br></div>		</td>
