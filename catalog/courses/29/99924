<div><h3>TA 202 - Dance Composition </h3>  <p><hr>Dance Composition introduces students to principles and practices of creating and learning dance choreography as a form of human expression. Students will engage in activities that generate movement using imagination through improvisation, manipulating movement using principles of composition, creating and performing short movement studies, and observing, analyzing, and self-reflecting in spoken and written form. Students will apply an experiential learning approach to the creative processes that will provide opportunities and challenges that stretch the imagination about what can be represented through movement and dance.</p>
