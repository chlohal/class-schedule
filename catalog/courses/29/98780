<p><span style="color:#202020;font-size:10pt;">The transition to &#8220;sustainable futures&#8221; will be achieved through a process of social-technical integration and innovation.<span>  </span>Pivotal to this innovation is the participatory application of environmental models to represent baseline systems and to forecast what those systems may look like in the future.<span>  </span>Environmental systems are complex, open systems. <span> </span>The course material has three parts: 1) An overview of methods and approaches to modeling; 2) the state of the art for modeling environmental processes; and 3) tools and models for management.<span>  </span>Current and future developments are also discussed.<span>  </span>The approach to the course is one that simplifies complex systems, introducing students to modeling software and tools using practical examples from climatology, ecology, hydrology, geomorphology and engineering. <span> </span>A group project applies one model or a cluster of models to a real place/issue of interest to students.<span>  </span>The course text has an associated website containing color images, links to web resources and chapter support pages, including data sets relating to case studies, exercises and model animations.<span>  </span></span><br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> Fall<br><br></p></div>		</td>
