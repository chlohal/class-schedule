<div><h3>IDND 220 - Vienna, 1890-1938: Capital of Tradition, Innovation, Promise, and Peril </h3>  <p><hr>From the latter nineteenth century through the 1930s, Vienna was a cauldron of crucial<br>
developments. It was a space of dynamic achievements in music, modern art, architecture,<br>
urban planning, psychoanalysis, and popular culture, as well as a vital cultural crossroad<br>
for migrants and refugees, in particular Jews, from Eastern and Central Europe. Vienna<br>
was also an important site for the evolution of political movements of the right and the<br>
left, leading ultimately to the Nazi disaster starting in 1938.<br>
This interdisciplinary seminar will explore the interactions of art, culture and the<br>
politics that emerged in Vienna from the turn-of-the-century through 1938. We will bring<br>
various critical lens to bear on these issues and also consider how these developments<br>
continue to impact our contemporary world in a various, sometimes surprising ways</p>

<p>Guest speakers will visit our seminar (virtually) during the semester. As a culmination<br>
of the semester, our guest speakers and additional scholars share and discuss their<br>
research as part of a scholarly symposium on campus. The students in the seminar will<br>
have the opportunity to participate in this conference and bring their ideas and<br>
perspectives to the discussion.<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> Bi-annually<br><br></p></div>		</td>
