<div><h3>IMED 3200 - Procedural Art </h3>  <p><hr>This course will introduce students to procedural methods of modeling, rendering, and animating three-dimensional, computer generated objects, environments, and characters. Students will implement and use frequently recurring procedural building blocks such as structural/functional decomposition, iteration, stochastic functions, recursion, and high-level control. They will then, individually or in teams, implement or use an advanced application of these techniques, choosing one of the following areas: artificial evolution, rule-based growth, physically based motion, and behavioral animation.</p>

<p>Previous knowledge/experience with coding/programming, game engines, and 3D art/modeling are helpful.<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> fall<br><br></p></div>		</td>
