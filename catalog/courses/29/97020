<div><h3>ARTH 143 - Art from 1940 to 1970: Modernism and Its Discontents </h3>  <hr>A survey of the major trends in art between 1940 and 1970, focused primarily on the art scene in the U.S. and Europe. We will begin with the emergence of New York as the center of the international avant-garde and the seat of Abstract Expressionism in the years after World War II. Abstract Expressionism is typically understood as the exemplary moment in high modernism, and we&#8217;ll discuss how an artist&#8217;s gender and race profoundly shaped this influential moment. The course will then trace the disintegrating confidence of mid-twentieth-century modernism, examining such movements as neo-Dadaism, pop art, minimalism, land art, and AfriCOBRA. We will discuss how these movements critiqued both modernism and postwar society itself, as they paralleled (and participated in) the Civil Rights protests and international student uprisings of the 1960s.<br><br><strong>Course Designation/Attribute:</strong> AP<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> Offered every other year<br><br></div>		</td>
