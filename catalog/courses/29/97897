<div><h3>IDCE 340 - Fundamentals of Youth Work </h3>  <p><hr><span style="font-size:11pt;">Youth workers are the front line staff at youth serving organizations, such as the Boys and Girls Club and youth centers.<span>  </span>Youth workers have been referred to as &#8220;wizards&#8221; because they succeed with young people where other individuals and institutions have failed.<span>  </span><span> </span>Despite the critical role youth workers play in the lives of young people, they receive very little professional development or training; this comes to the detriment of the youth, the youth workers, and the field.<span>  </span><span> </span>There are emerging efforts in the United States to professionalize youth work and provide youth workers with critical training.<span>  </span>This course is a one strategy to that end. </span><span style="font-size:11pt;"> </span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:11pt;">This course covers how to work with young people in a positive youth development framework-focusing on building protective factors (e.g<span>. positive discipline, making referrals, and building relationships with families)</span><span>, reducing risk factors </span><span>(e.g. violence, mental health problems, sexual behavior, and substance abuse) </span><span>and building professional skills in program development and management.</span><span>  Reflection on youth work practice will be a key teaching and learning strategy in the course.<span>  </span>Students in this class will be both community youth workers as well as Clark students.<span>  </span>For Clark students who are not currently doing youth work, they will be matched with youth workers for an apprenticeship opportunity.<span>  </span>Each week, a different youth development professional in the greater Worcester area will co-facilitate the course session.<span>  </span>In this way, students have the opportunity to network with those working in the field.</span></span></p>
