<div><h3>HIST 319 - History of American Women </h3>  <hr>This course moves through the chronology of American history to examine  the broad themes that have shaped women&#8217;s lives in the United States  from the colonial period to the present. While tracing larger trends and  identifying common experiences, we will also pay close attention to the  specific experiences of individual women in order to shed light on the  differences and divisions among them. Throughout, we will investigate  the ways in which notions of gender difference have changed over time  and how a wide variety of women both created and responded to shifting  and contested cultural, political, and social roles.<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> Offered every year<br><br></div>		</td>
