<div><h3>PSCI 284 - Capstone Seminar: Popular Culture And International Relations (IR) </h3>  <p><hr>This course examines the connection between international relations (IR) and popular culture through the examination of different modes, or tools, of popular culture and how these intersect with international relations theories as well as exploring popular culture to understand historical events in IR (World War I and II; Cold War; Post-Cold War; and the Post-9/11 and War on Terror). Recognizing the interdisciplinarity of the study of popular culture, we will read works by scholars in other disciplines, including film and media studies, history, and geography. Questions this course will consider include: How does popular culture relate to IR? How are IR concepts and topics represented and reproduced in popular culture? How can IR theories explain popular culture? How do different actors-both state and non-state actors-use popular culture for political goals?</p>
