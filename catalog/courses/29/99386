<div><h3>HIST 371 - Christians, Jews, and Muslims in Europe, 1100-1900 </h3>  <hr>European Christians, Jews, and Muslims have lived alongside each other, in tension and in tolerance, for well over a millennium.  Modern conflicts between these monotheistic religions dominate the European news cycle and political imagination.  The recent history of the relationship between European Christians, Jews and Muslims is well-known and much-discussed, both in academic and popular analyses.  But what exactly are the roots of these conflicts and confluences?  This class will examine the relationship between Christians, Jews, and Muslims in Europe from 1100-1900.  It will explore economic, social, cultural, intellectual, and political developments during this period.  In doing so, it will examine alliance and antagonism; toleration and expulsion; assimilation and separation; and the long history of contemporary issues.<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> Regularly<br><br></div>		</td>
