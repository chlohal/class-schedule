<div><h3>PHYS 1010 - Introductory Physics I </h3>  <hr>This is an introductory level course stressing both conceptual understanding and problem solving skills. This is a survey course for undergraduate students irrespective of their major. The course stresses the simplicity and self-consistency of physical models in explaining a variety of physical phenomena. Topics include Newtonian mechanics, Mechanical Waves and a brief introduction to the thermal properties of matter. Calculus is not required, but elements of algebra and trigonometry are reviewed and utilized. PHYS 1010, with PHYS 1020, fulfills the usual entrance equiremnets for medical and dental schools. Labs are integrated within the course frame work, and will be conducted at the same classroom where lectures are held. Computer simulations will be utilized to enhance students&#8217; understanding of course topics. Students will be charged a $100 Lab Fee.<br><br><strong>Course Designation/Attribute:</strong> SP (summer only)<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> varies<br><br></div>		</td>
