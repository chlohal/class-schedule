<div><h3>PSCI 102 - Political Science Fiction </h3>  <hr>First-year seminar/Science fiction enables us to study the contemporary political world from a distance-to shed light on its problems and its weaknesses, and to be imaginative about alternatives, both hope-filled and deeply disturbing. This course will explore important questions and concepts in the study of politics through various works of science fiction, including novels, short stories, and films. Through science fiction, we will consider ideas like power, authority, legitimacy, and identity. We will also take up works of science fiction that examine and critique political systems, including democracy and dictatorship. We will read works that explore issues of racism and sexism through utopian and dystopian visions of society, and will consider the meaning and value of equality, as well as other controversial issues.<br><br><strong>Course Designation/Attribute:</strong> GP<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> First-Year Seminar<br><br></div>		</td>
