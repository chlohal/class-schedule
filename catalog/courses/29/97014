<div><h3>ARTH 118 - Art in the Age of Alexander the Great </h3>  <hr>By his death in 323 B.C., at age 33, Alexander the Great had conquered most of the known world, his empire stretching from Greece to the Indus River Valley of India. In the process, he transformed this region into a polyglot, multicultural mix that has been compared to the global village in which we live today. This course examines the life and times of Alexander and his followers through the record of the material culture they left behind: architecture, sculpture, painting, gold, coins, jewelry and everyday artifacts. It specifically examines how culture is shaped by such material goods and uses an historical perspective to gain insight to the ever-changing profile of our society today.
