<div><h3>MUSC 099 - Music and Politics </h3>  <p><hr>Music and Politics explores intersections between music and politics. During the semester we will consider how, when, and why music reflects and influences political conditions and/or represents, instigates, expresses, critiques, or drives political sentiment.  The course begins by introducing some important themes, issues, and approaches to the study of music and politics.  We will then explore some significant case studies; these will include musical politics before and during the Nazi era in Germany, music and cold war politics, and the politics of popular music in the US and the world in the current century.   Students will then begin to branch out, working as collaborative groups to explore topics and themes that relate to the broad theme of music and politics.   Each group will design, produce, and publish the results of their collective work in a web-based format, incorporating text with music examples, images, video, and/or other graphics.</p>
