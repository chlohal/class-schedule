<div><h3>GEOG 375 - Technology and Sustainability: Perspectives from the Global South </h3>  <hr>Examines the nature of technologies and their relationships to socioeconomic and environmental change in the developing world. Readings and discussions will address and critique theories on technology change, the role of technologies in development, and their real-world implications (good and bad) for developing regions. Theoretical literature will be linked to empirical case studies of agricultural, energy, financing, information-communication, and/or manufacturing technologies in Sub-Saharan Africa, Latin America, and South/Southeast Asia. The key objective of the course is to deepen and complicate students&#8217; understandings of the ways in which technologies are developed, diffused, and absorbed and about how these processes influence communities and economies in the Global South.<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> Offered every other year<br><br></div>		</td>
