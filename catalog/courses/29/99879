<p>This course aims to understand the location of evil within text and visual media of the past and present: the evil of &#8220;the other&#8221; and the outsider, versus the evil within ourselves. We will research and discuss infamous names like Ted Bundy, Ed Kemper, Aileen Wuornos and Ed Gein as serial killers of American history. We will study the disturbing annals of Grimm&#8217;s fairy tales written far before Walt Disney got his hands on them We will journey through the myths and realities of witchcraft and witch-hunts as well as the roles that gender and age play upon each. Students are encouraged to be creative, insightful and open-minded, especially in narrative voice and analysis within formal and informal assignments assigned throughout the semester.</p>
