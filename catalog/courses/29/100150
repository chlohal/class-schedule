<div><h3>CYES 110 - Social Justice and Community Engagement </h3>  <hr>An interdisciplinary team-taught course, this &#8220;Clark Commons&#8221; First-Year Intensive Seminar is rooted in the idea that community-engaged scholarship is a powerful mechanism for promoting transformative change and social justice in our community and world. Clark has a long history of community-engaged activist scholarship. This seminar will introduce first year students to key principles and practices of activist scholarship - what this work looks like and how it&#8217;s done. Students will be introduced to an interdisciplinary group of engaged scholars/faculty on campus, exploring their passions, positionality and identities, and their work. Lastly, students will begin their own journey in activist work at Clark -learning about on-going work, and designing a project proposal for their own transformational work, in the spirit of Clark&#8217;s motto: &#8220;Challenge convention; Change our world.&#8221;<br><br><strong>Course Designation/Attribute:</strong> VP<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> Annually<br><br></div>		</td>
