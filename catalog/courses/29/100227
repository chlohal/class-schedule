<div><h3>GEOG 302 - Climate Dynamics Seminar </h3>  <hr>Climate change is the defining issue of our time, and the field of climate dynamics is rapidly evolving. There are many issues being debated within the scientific community, as well as in public arenas, that are not covered in textbooks. The goal of this seminar course is to provide students with a fundamental knowledge of climate dynamics and to expose them to emerging topics in the literature. Specific topics may include climate change detection and attribution; large-scale modes of climate variability (e.g., ENSO, PDO) and teleconnections; atmospheric circulation; tropical climate change; earth system models; downscaling methods; extreme events; methodological advances in climate research; climate adaptation and mitigation. Open to doctoral and master&#8217;s students.<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> annually<br><br></div>		</td>
