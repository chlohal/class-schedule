<div><h3>PECO 101 - Introduction to Peace Studies </h3>  <hr>The 21<sup>st</sup> century has seen the proliferation of terrorism, war, and increasing economic and ecological precarity throughout much of the world. In these uncertain times, human and non-human exposure to vulnerably and violence has intensified. In a moment where coalescing fundamentalisms and right-wing populisms expand globally, what does it mean to be a &#8216;chisel of peace&#8217;? What does it mean, in other words, to resist mechanisms of violence without reproducing their terms, at home or abroad? What are the institutions, ethical codes, and moral principals of non-violent resistance? And when is violence justified? Offering an introductory survey of the interdisciplinary field of Peace and Conflict Studies, this course addresses these and other important questions.<br>
