<div><h3>ARTH 159 - Latin-American Art </h3>  <hr>Surveys the art and architecture of Latin America, ranging from Argentina to the United States, from the pre-Columbian period to the present. Begins with an exploration of the art of Mesoamerica and the Andes before the arrival of the Europeans, including the Olmecs, Maya, Aztecs and Inca. Explores the cultural convergence that resulted from the conquest in the 16th century, focusing on the role of indigenous artists and traditions in the formation of early Colonial culture. Traces the development of the colonial arts, considering the role of civil and religious patronage, the rise of the art guilds, the international makeup of European cultures in the Americas and the relationship with the arts of Spain and Portugal. Considers the rise of nationalism in the 17th and 18th centuries and its effect on the arts, including the revival of Amerindian forms by the independence movement in regions that would later become Peru and Mexico. Explores the development of the arts from independence from Spain and Portugal in the early 19th century to the present-day Latin American Art.
