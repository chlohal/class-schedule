<div><h3>HIST 171 - Traditional China </h3>  <hr>This course is an introduction to Chinese history from its very beginnings until 1650. It was during this remote period that vitally important foundations were laid for Chinese civilization. Ranging over the centuries, we will survey some of the most important developments in Chinese politics, culture, and society, which includes Confucianism, Buddhism, Daoism, and Legalism as competing and sometimes intersecting philosophical systems, the changing pressures and influences upon the lives of ordinary Chinese men and women, and the evolution of the imperial system.<br><br><strong>Course Designation/Attribute:</strong> HP<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> Annually<br><br></div>		</td>
