<div><h3>PSCI 285 - INTERVENTION IN GLOBAL POLITICS </h3>  <p><hr>What is intervention? Who intervenes, why, and how? What is the purpose of intervention, and what ends are served by it? This capstone seminar is built around in-depth exploration of these and other related questions spawned by one of the most significant, complex, and hotly contested topics in the contemporary international system. As befits the subject matter, our exploration will be wide-ranging in both scope and form. We begin the course with careful examination of intervention as a concept, focusing in particular on the ongoing difficulty of the international community in reaching a consensus on what constitutes intervention, under what conditions it is permissible, and what its purpose and function is. From that point of origin, we will then turn our attention to the varieties of intervention behavior, through an extensive inventory of the major types of intervention and its more readily identifiable practitioners, causes, and rationales. In doing so, we will refer to numerous empirical case studies in order to ground the larger theory and concepts surrounding intervention in &#8216;real world&#8217; practice.</p>
