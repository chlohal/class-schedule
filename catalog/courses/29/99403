<p><strong>SPRING 2023 TOPIC: INTRODUCTION TO SUFISM</strong></p>

<p>For over a thousand years, Sufism has been the mystic path of Islam and a dynamic expression of the inner quest of God-consciousness. Therefore, it has been rendered as the heart of Islam. </p>

<p>This course offers a survey of the origins, development, and various expressions of Sufism, Islam&#8217;s mystical tradition. The course will begin with an inquiry into how the term &#8220;Sufism&#8221; has been constructed in modern religious studies, offer an overview of key concepts, and will then shift focus to the historical manifestations of Islamic mysticism in a variety of linguistic and cultural zones. </p>

<p>This will set the stage for a careful presentation of the major concepts, themes, and practices which have animated the Sufi tradition from past to present.</p>
