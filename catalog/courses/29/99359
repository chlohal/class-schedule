<div><h3>PHYS 1020 - Introductory Physics II </h3>  <hr>This course is a continuation of PHYS 1010. Topics include: Electricity, Magnetism, Optics and a brief account of modern physics. The PHYS 1010-1020 sequence is designed to fulfill most of the science perspective of the usual entrance exam requirements for medical and dental schools. Calculus is not required, but elements of algebra and trigonometry are reviewed and utilized. Labs are integrated within the course frame work, and will be conducted at the same classroom where lectures are held. Computer simulations will be utilized to enhance students&#8217; understanding of course topics. Students will be charged a $100 Lab Fee.<br><br><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Introduction to Physics I.<br><br><strong>Course Designation/Attribute:</strong> SP (summer only)<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> varies<br><br></div>		</td>
