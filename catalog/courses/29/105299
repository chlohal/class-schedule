<div><h3>GEOG 327 - The Politics of Sensing </h3>  <hr>This course contends that proliferating environmental sensors (e.g., camera traps; smartphones) and scientific retheorizations of the human/animal senses (sight, hearing, touch) are together refiguring human-environment relations - with consequence to core disciplinary debates. It operates as a survey course, pursuing work that deliberates on the roles that sensors and &#8220;the senses&#8221; are playing in contemporary environment-making: from animal studies, political ecology, and political geography to black geographies and media studies. In pursuing an analytical &#8216;cut&#8217; across these seemingly disparate areas - &#8220;the politics of sensing&#8221; aims to equip students with new tools for pursuing cross-disciplinary synergies and establishing points of engagement within an ever-widening geographical project.<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> Annually<br><br></div>		</td>
