<div><h3>HIST 152 - Jews in Early Modern Europe and Colonial America </h3>  <hr>Between ca. 1400 and ca. 1800, the rights of most European Jews were severely restricted. Their story can only be told if we take into account the actions and measures of &#8220;gentiles&#8221; vis-a-vis the Jews. Having established what these conditions were, we will direct our attention to Jewish cultural and religious practices. The course starts with late medieval Christian myths and stories about Jews, scapegoating mechanisms and outright persecution. The course will end with the extension of greater freedom to the Jews in the Age of Democratic Revolutions, which made the question of assimilation an important issue.<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> Offered periodically<br><br></div>		</td>
