<div><h3>ARTS 132 - Painting I </h3>  <p><hr>Seeing and Believing/Rotating Faculty: Emphasis on representational painting strategies. Introduces the fundamentals of craft and explores the synthetic possibilities of paint, while discussing the conceptual basis for this medium (Why paint?). Focuses on material-both the materials employed by the painter, and the materials the painter simulates. Painting as a vehicle for thinking and communication will be stressed. Students who have taken ARTS 132 Painting I: Self Made Worlds may take ARTS 132 Painting I: Seeing and Believing for full credit.</p>

<p>Self- Made Worlds/Rotating Faculty: Emphasis on constructing alternative realities. The painted image has been with us since the first handprint appeared on a cave wall. It remains an intimate and powerful index of an individual&#8217;s quest for self-expression, and acts as a mirror of culture&#8217;s changing image of itself. The basic toolbox of painting techniques will be explored along with an introduction to painters and painting concerns from the past through to the contemporary moment. The emphasis of this course will shift depending on the professor.
