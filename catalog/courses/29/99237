<div><h3>ENG 123 - Voicing the Verse:  Poetry in Performance </h3>  <p><hr>This course will focus on the creativity and craft involved in both writing and oral presentation. Through diving into texts and techniques ranging from Homer to Hip hop, students will examine and become more knowledgable about how language, spoken and unspoken, is used to create meaning and connections with an audience. In addition to writing, reading, and/or rehearsing poetry, storytelling, rap, spoken word, slam poetry, political speeches, etc&#8230;, students will weekly write 300-400 word observations focusing on how aspects of language and/or performance were effectively used in any creative media with which they&#8217;ve engaged. This course is especially useful for students interested in careers in which writing and public presentation are required. For English majors, this course satisfies the C-1 requirement. For English minors, this course counts for the poetry requirement.</p>
