<div><h3>SOC 252 - Race and Autobiography </h3>  <p><hr>During the semester, we will explore ways that racialized subjects in the United States give meaning to their lives through the genre of autobiography. What is the relationship between race, gender, and class in the construction of life stories? How are narratives shaped by a broader socio-historical context? Students will have the opportunity to write their own autobiographical reflections with race at the center and make connections between the assigned texts and their own lives.</p>
