<div><h3>FREN 297 - Honors </h3>  <p><hr>This honors program is for language, literature and culture majors only. By November 1 of the capstone semester, faculty will identify qualified senior majors (with a minimum GPA of 3.5) and invite them to submit a proposal for a semester-long honors thesis during the spring of their senior year. Other students who wish to take honors should identify an area of interest during the capstone semester, consult with the capstone professor and/or an appropriate honors adviser, and submit a proposal (by December 1) to the professor they would like to direct the project.*</p>

<ul>
	<li>Proposals will be approved at the discretion of the individual professor.</li>
	<li>The Department Chair must also approve the project.</li>
	<li>The honors candidate and adviser will decide on a work schedule, but a preliminary draft must be completed by the first week of April.</li>
	<li>The final version is due one week before the last day of classes.</li>
	<li>A second faculty reader will participate in the final evaluation of the honors project.</li>
	<li>An honors project counts as one unit of credit.</li>
</ul>

<p>*Students graduating early and wishing to do an honors project should see their adviser during the fall of their junior year and get approval for the project from the thesis director and the department chair.<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> Annually<br><br><strong>Placement Guidelines</strong><br> Please visit the <a href="http://www.clarku.edu/departments/foreign/undergraduate/placement.cfm" target="_blank">Department of Language, Literature and Culture</a> for the language placement guidelines.<br><br></p></div>		</td>
