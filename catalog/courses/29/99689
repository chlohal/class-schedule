<div><h3>PSCI 015 - The European Union: Historical, Political, and Legal Perspectives </h3>  <hr>Course Description: The European Union: Historical, Political, and Legal Perspectives<br>
After World War II, in order to help prevent another major war in Europe, several countries including France, Germany, Italy, and the three Benelux countries joined together in what would eventually become the European Union.  This political science course will examine the European Union experiment from historical, political, and legal points of view.  Today the European Union has 28 countries, with others hoping to join.  Some of the countries have a common currency (the Euro), citizens of all of the E.U. countries have the right to live and work in any of the E.U. member states, and European law has been superimposed over national laws.  We will look at how and why the number of member states in the E.U. expanded over time, as well as looking at why voters in the United Kingdom voted to leave the European Union in what is known as Brexit. We will examine how the Treaties of the E.U. have become constitutionalized.  The course will also examine how the European Union manages the tricky politics among the 28 member states and the voters across Europe.  We will also look at current issues like the Greek debt crisis and the refugee crisis in Europe.  <br>
