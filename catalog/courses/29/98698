<div><h3>CMLT 222 - Faust and the Faustian </h3>  <hr>Faust-the scholar who makes a deal with the devil in order to achieve knowledge, love and power-is one of the great myths of modernity. In this course we will study the figure of Faust and roots of the Faustian tradition. We will try to understand why this particular myth has resonated so strongly in modern Western culture. In particular, we will examine the ways in which the Faust story has been used to examine: knowledge, scholarship and the academic life; the creative process; political and historical questions, particularly the Holocaust; gender and the apparent masculinity of this story; and humanity&#8217;s perfectibility and/or guilt. Primary texts for the course will include Marlowe&#8217;s Doctor Faustus, Goethe&#8217;s Faust, Bulgakov&#8217;s The Master and Margarita, Thomas Mann&#8217;s Doctor Faustus, as well as operas and films.<br><br><strong>Course Designation/Attribute:</strong> VP<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> -<br><br></div>		</td>
