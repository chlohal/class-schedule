<div><h3>PHIL 244 - Hume </h3>  <hr>This class is dedicated to central questions and texts in the philosophy of David Hume. His philosophical proposals earned him labels like &#8220;rebel,&#8221; &#8220;sceptic,&#8221; &#8220;infidel,&#8221; and &#8220;heretic.&#8221; But at the same time his successors showed great interest in his views. Questions discussed might include the following: Can science give us certainty? Is suicide moral? Do we have a right to political rebellion? Can religion be rational? Can we argue about beauty? For the exact texts and questions on the schedule for a given semester please see the philosophy department website and/or the instructor&#8217;s website and feel free to get in touch with questions.<br><br><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> P= two (2) in Philosophy including PHIL143 (early modern european philosophy) or perm<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> bi-annually<br><br></div>		</td>
