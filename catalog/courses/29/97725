<div><h3>HIST 213 - Gender and the American City </h3>  <hr>This course considers how the experiences and spaces of nineteenth-century urban life were shaped by and, in turn, shaped gendered assumptions about men and women.  How did men and women experience the city differently?  What aspects of urban life defined or reinforced gender differences?  Did city life create opportunities to transform gender roles? How did city dwellers use their gendered values and concerns to shape the city through reform, leisure, or work?  Specific topics for discussion will include: gendered spaces in the city, the symbolic role of gender in the urban landscape, the interaction of sexual and racial identities with the city&#8217;s gendered terrain, and the place of gender in urban leisure and cultural institutions.<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> Offered periodically<br><br></div>		</td>
