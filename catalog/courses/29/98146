<div><h3>MUSC 201 - Music, Media & Public Spheres </h3>  <hr>Much of studying music at school focuses on the acquisition of skills, techniques and technological proficiencies for performance &amp; composition, the development of an historical, formal and critical understanding of musical styles, and the presentation of this knowledge to the University community. &#8220;Music–making, Media &amp; Public Spheres&#8221; presumes this background, but shifts the focus toward the world off-campus. This course is primarily intended as a platform to provide support to students as they design and complete their capstone projects that involve music. The presumption is that these projects will contain a significant component that is directed to off-campus constituencies (audiences, other music professionals, businesses, entrepreneurial enterprises). A project might consist of preparing, planning and executing an off-campus concert or recital, or designing and mounting a netLabel (a record label that distributes its music primarily through digital audio formats), which publicly presents recordings of student–produced music. This seminar will provide a context and support for these endeavors both academically and as a community of practice. This community will include both student musicians (composers, performers, critics, technologist) as well as Communication &amp; Culture students interested the production of musical media. This course will begin with a through study of how musical media structures public spheres, as well as how people use musical media to participate in the public sphere. Subsequent units will address issues related to contemporary contexts for musical creation, professional and commercial musical industries and institutions, the Internet as a determining site for music–making and consumption, and music as a live event.<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> Offered every other year.<br><br></div>		</td>
