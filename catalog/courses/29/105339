<div><h3>DSCI 103 - Data, Computing and Society </h3>  <hr>Data in the 21st Century draws many parallels to Oil in the 18th Century, while its use is increasing,<br>
its applications and full utility remain largely untapped. While limited in usefulness it its raw<br>
form, substantial value arises from its refining, that is the derivative forms from its processing,<br>
mixture with other components, and its transformation. Such processes on Data are purposed with<br>
gaining insights, nuggets of information not directly observable. One finds achievement of<br>
efficiencies engendered by the refining of data ranging broadly across diverse domains from<br>
transportation and commerce to entertainment and healthcare. More recently, governments have<br>
employed data to improve apportionment of funds and delivery of critical services. An<br>
organization&#8217;s ability to employ data and use it to generate insights enables better decision-making.<br>
In this course, we cover introductory concepts purposed with building student background in the<br>
Data Science process, that is posing questions, gathering data, developing analyses, and articulating<br>
data-informed decisions. We also introduce students to entry level computational tools and<br>
methods purposed with extracting insights from data as we survey the Data Science process and consider its impact. Students will also be challenged to consider issues concerning privacy, bias,<br>
and ethics surrounding data and crafting data-informed decisions. A goal of the course is to<br>
expose students to examples from varied domains.<br><br><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> MATH 119 OR 120 OR 124 OR GEOG 110 OR ECON 160 OR SOC 202 OR PSYC 105 OR PSCI 107 OR QBUS 110 OR BIOL 106<br><br><strong>Corequisites:</strong> MATH 119 OR 120 OR 124 OR GEOG 110 OR ECON 160 OR SOC 202 OR PSYC 105 OR PSCI 107 OR QBUS 110 OR BIOL 106<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> Annually (Depending of availability of faculty to teach it)<br><br></div>		</td>
