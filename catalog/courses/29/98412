<div><h3>PSYC 297 - Honors </h3>  <p><hr>The Psychology Honors sequence is a two-semester experience designed to guide selected honors students through the design and execution of an independent honors research project. The Psychology Honors sequence is designed to be especially, but not uniquely, attractive to students interested in pursuing graduate study in Psychology or another related discipline such as medicine, teaching, and the law. The major focus of the experience is the completion of an individual research project conducted in close collaboration with a faculty mentor. These collaborations typically occur in individual meetings, as well as group meetings as part of the faculty member&#8217;s research team. In the fall of senior year, the student will develop the research project, submit a proposal to the IRB, and begin the project. In the spring semester students will complete their individual research projects and prepare written and oral presentations. Honors students are encouraged to present their projects at Academic Spree Day.</p>

<p>Students interested in pursuing an Honors project must apply to the department during the spring semester of their junior year. In addition, students are strongly encouraged to have identified a possible faculty supervisor as early as the end of the sophomore year, as some faculty members may require that Honors students enroll in their research course and/or take a Directed Study with them during junior year, in order to start developing their Honors thesis prior to the senior year.</p>

<p><strong>This course fulfills the capstone requirement of the Psychology major.</strong><br>
