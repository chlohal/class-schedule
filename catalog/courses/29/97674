<div><h3>HIST 039 - The American Home: Power, Place, and Gender </h3>  <hr>In order to underscore both the unity and diversity of nineteenth-century cultural life, this course revisits the variety of places Americans called home &#8211;middle-class suburban houses to working-class tenements, frontier dugouts to urban settlement houses&#8211;while considering the shifting interpretations of these spaces from within and without. Beginning with the rise of home as a haven from the uncertainties of public life, it traces the popular celebration of home as a moral force, notes the movement of domesticity into the public worlds of politics and reform, and concludes with a consideration of home&#8217;s relationship with and penetration by and of the marketplace.<br><br><strong>Course Designation/Attribute:</strong> HP<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> Offered periodically.<br><br></div>		</td>
