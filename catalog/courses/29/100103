<div><h3>GEOG 156 - Getting to Zero: Clean Energy for a Climate-Safe Future </h3>  <hr>This course focuses on scalable solutions for carbon neutrality.   The goal of this course is to learn about, and apply, a quantitative approach to sizing up the technical potential of a range of clean energy technologies that could support the transition to a low carbon society.  Students will explore clean energy solutions applicable for electricity supply, heating and cooling, transportation and more. In parallel, students will investigate climate change mitigation policies and actions being pursued in Massachusetts, in New England, in the U.S., and around the world.  Students will also their emerging understanding of clean energy solutions to the case of Clark University to examine what Clark University might do to achieve carbon neutrality.  This course satisfies the Formal Analysis requirement by emphasizing quantitative analysis as a basis for critical reasoning about of the opportunities of various technologies for meeting the clean energy challenge, including symbolic equations used for quantitative assessments and for modeling alternative outcomes.<br><br><strong>Course Designation/Attribute:</strong>  FA<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> every 4 years in fall<br><br></div>		</td>
