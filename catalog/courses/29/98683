<div><h3>SOC 215 - Sociology of Education </h3>  <hr>This course explores sociological research and theories that are useful for examining the roles of educational institutions and practices in the United States.  We will critically examine the place and role of schools and schooling in the wider society, through a brief historical overview as well as modern perspectives and current debates on the role and function of schools.  Issues to be discussed include  the purpose of schooling, the structure and organization of schools, curriculum development, social reproduction, family/school relationships, and the role of teachers.  The meaning of culture, race and ethnicity, gender, socioeconomic status, disability, sexual orientation and identity will also inform our investigations into these topics.<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> Occasionally<br><br></div>		</td>
