<div><h3>CHEM 385 - The Chemistry of Materials that Store Energy </h3>  <hr><span class="fontstyle0">Establishing zero-carbon societies is of paramount importance for our planet&#8217;s future and will require developing superior energy storage technologies. In this course, students will explore the chemistry of materials that store energy. Students will discover the multiple roles that nanostructured transition metal complexes, carbon allotropes and conducting polymers play in electrochemical capacitors and batteries. The fundamental chemical concepts that dictate electronic, capacitive and pseudocapacitive behavior of materials will be studied. This course strives to pinpoint chemical fundamentals by describing connections between molecular structure and charge transfer events responsible for energy storage. Characterization of materials via spectroscopic and electrochemical techniques as well as the fabrication of electrochemical cells will be investigated.</span><br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> Annually<br><br></div>		</td>
