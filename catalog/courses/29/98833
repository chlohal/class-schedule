<div><h3>ENG 327 - The Book in the Early Modern World </h3>  <p><hr><hr>
<p>The rise of the printed book in early modern Europe is associated with corresponding renewal and innovation in science, letters, and theology. As with so many widely accepted narratives, however, the story turns out to be messier, more complicated, and ultimately more interesting than broadly understood. In this seminar, hands-on laboratory assignments with rare material from the Jonas Clark collection at Goddard Library&#8217;s Archives and Special Collections supplement readings as students explore major topics in early modern book history-the emergence of the codex; moveable type and the persistence of manuscript; the technology of the early hand press; design issues from typography to bindings; communications circuits; histories of reading; bibliographic identity. Toward the end of the semester, the class holds a Rare Book Open House with exhibits and demonstrations of material from Archives and Special Collections. No previous knowledge is required or expected, but an interest in books as material and technological objects is strongly recommended. The course may be of particular interest to students in English; History; Cultural Studies and Communication; Media, Culture and the Arts; Comparative Literature; Ancient Civilization; Studio Art; and Art History. <br>
