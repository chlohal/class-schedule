<div><h3>MUSC 101 - Bach and Before: Exploring Music in the Early Modern World </h3>  <p><hr>This course explores music and musical life during the late Medieval and Early Modern eras, or from ca. 1100 to 1770 CE.  The course covers a wide range of musical repertory, including outstanding examples from the Renaissance and Baroque periods.  The course takes particular interest in issues related to gender, music and the body, musical intersections beyond Europe, and the musical performance of extreme states of emotion.  In addition to delving deeply into musical works, we will engage with cultural studies, social history, technology, and aesthetics.</p>

<p>Previous musical experience and the ability to read music are helpful, but not required. Curiosity about music and the willingness to listen deeply to a range of musical styles are, however, absolutely necessary.<br><br><strong>Course Designation/Attribute:</strong> HP<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> Offered periodically<br><br></p></div>		</td>
