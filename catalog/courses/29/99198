<div><h3>PHYS 367 - Fluid Mechanics and Applications </h3>  <hr>Fluids refer to liquid and gas state of matter which covers more than 70% of the surface of the Earth and all of atmosphere. This course will explore the physics of fluids, and doing calculations using analytical and numerical techniques in weekly instructor led discussion sessions, and a semester long group based project. The project will include building a table top demonstration, and making a video presentation. Examples of project topics include water, oil and gas processing in industry, designing robots that swim, water purification, and more.<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> Bi-annually<br><br></div>		</td>
