<div><h3>CYES 294 - Praxis Thesis Capstone </h3>  <p><hr>This seminar supports students in producing (and defending) original work of quality and consequence.  The capstone thesis and digital portfolio demonstrate a CYES student&#8217;s capacity for integrating theory and practice; showing creativity, discipline, resilience, and intellectual excellence - needed to engage in original, self-directed work of consequence for the neighborhood or community at large. Towards the end of the Praxis Capstone Thesis course, CYES majors will submit their portfolio including their praxis project thesis to their committee for review.  The student&#8217;s committee will be composed of the praxis project thesis chair who will be a CYES affiliated faculty, a second university faculty reader, and a community member (ideally someone involved with their project).  A fourth non-voting member of the committee will include a junior level CYES major.  The Capstone Project is presented in a CYES Colloquium on Engaged Scholarship.  To complete, students must:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Submit a first draft of their thesis by March 15;</li>
	<li>Present their work at Academic Spree Day and/or at a national conference;</li>
	<li>Complete an oral defense with first and second readers and community committee member(s).</li>
</ul>

<p>Upon satisfactory completion of the course and the program, the CYES Program Praxis Committee may recommend graduation with departmental honors.  For an Honors designation, the praxis project thesis should be of publishable quality, generate new knowledge or tools, and leave a legacy for the community, program, or institution that demonstrates the role of engaged activist scholarship.<br><br><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> To be eligible to take the Capstone Thesis Course - students must have successfully completed <a href="preview_course_nopop.php?catoid=29&coid=99693" onclick="acalogPopup('preview_course.php?catoid=29&coid=99693&print', '3', 770, 530, 'yes');return false;" rel="remote /ajax/preview_course.php?catoid=29&coid=99693&display_options[location]=tooltip&show" id="tt8574" target="_blank">CYES 290</a><span style="display: none !important">&#160;</span> and <a href="preview_course_nopop.php?catoid=29&coid=99738" onclick="acalogPopup('preview_course.php?catoid=29&coid=99738&print', '3', 770, 530, 'yes');return false;" rel="remote /ajax/preview_course.php?catoid=29&coid=99738&display_options[location]=tooltip&show" id="tt4929" target="_blank">CYES 292</a><span style="display: none !important">&#160;</span>.<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> Every Spring<br><br></p><div style="display: none; z-index: 1000;" class="tooltip for_tt8574"></div><div style="display: none; z-index: 1000;" class="tooltip for_tt4929"></div></div>		</td>
