<div><h3>PHIL 106 - Science, Religion and Reality </h3>  <hr>The seminar will address some basic issues in the philosphy of science and the philosophy of religion: What is science? What is reality? How do science and religion differ with regard to the relative roles played by faith and evidence in establishing knowledge claims about reality? Does science provide better explanations than theology or literature? How do religious arguments for the existence of God differ from scientific arguments for the existence of dark matter? Special attention will be given to developing students&#8217; abilitites to read complex texts, write logically, think analytically and argue cogently.Â <br><br><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> You must be placed at the Verbal Expression level to be admitted into this seminar.<br><br><strong>Course Designation/Attribute:</strong> VE<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> Offered periodically<br><br></div>		</td>
