<div><h3>PSCI 120 - International Negotiation and Mediation </h3>  <hr>This course is designed to familiarize students with strategies and tactics of negotiation and bargaining in general, and specifically with negotiation and mediation in an international context.  The class will provide students with both exposure to prevailing theories and concepts of negotiation and mediation, as well as opportunities with direct, hands-on experience in these practices - as a means of illustrating the problems and possibilities of international interactions and conflict management and resolution.  The first portion of the course will consist of deep and sustained engagement with the literature on international negotiation and mediation, bargaining, and foreign policy decision-making in the international security, conflict, economic, and environmental arenas.  This engagement will be accomplished through a mix of in-class discussions, lectures, readings, and in-class exercises.  The remainder of the course will be devoted to the application of acquired knowledge and refinement of acquired skills through participation in complex and multifaceted simulated negotiations.
