<div><h3>PSCI 240 - Human Rights and International Politics </h3>  <p><hr>In recent years, questions of human rights and humanitarian concerns have been central to debates on such varied issues as U.S. relations with China, NATO&#8217;s role in the former Yugoslavia, and the United Nation&#8217;s place in the international system. The more general question of whether foreign policy should be based strictly on national interests or also include moral considerations has been long-standing, but it is particularly relevant in a post-Cold War world where national interests and priorities are less clear. Appeals to students interested in learning more about current policy disputes and in further exploring the impact of ideas in international politics.</p>
