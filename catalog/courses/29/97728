<p><strong>THE TOPIC OF THIS SEMINAR FOR SPRING 2023 IS</strong>: <strong>Antebellum America: Slavery, Industry, Empire</strong>.  In this course we will examine the dramatic economic, political, social and cultural transformations that took place in America between 1815-1860, including the growth of the market economy and solidification of a capitalist consciousness; evolution of both formal and informal politics; the creation and articulation of a unique American national identity, and the impetuses, strategies, and results of expansion.  We will explore these themes through the lenses of race and gender.  We will consider the centrality of slavery to all of these themes, as well as the many meanings and manifestations of &#8220;empire.&#8221;<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> Offered periodically<br><br></p></div>		</td>
