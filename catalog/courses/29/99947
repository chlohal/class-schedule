<div><h3>IDCE 309 - POLICY ANALYSIS </h3>  <hr>Nonprofit and public affairs professionals are faced with finding viable solutions to increasingly complex public problems-from reducing poverty to raising revenue to fix congested roadways. To develop solutions, policy analysts investigate public problems, formulate solutions, forecast outcomes, and choose between competing policy proposals. This course introduces students to the major institutions and processes involved in the development and implementation of public policy in the United States. We examine why some problems reach the public agenda, why some solutions are adopted and others rejected, and why some policies appear to succeed while others appear to fail. The course also explores a selection of current issues in American public policy that impact the work of nonprofit and public affairs professionals such as criminal justice reform, social safety net policies, immigration, education, health, and the environment. This course is designed to strengthen students&#8217; problem solving, analytic, and research skills in defining and crafting solutions to public problems.Â <br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> Annually<br><br></div>		</td>
