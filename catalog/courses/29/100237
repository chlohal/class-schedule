<div><h3>ID 230 - Theory and Methods in Genocide and Human Rights Studies </h3>  <hr>This seminar examines current inter- and trans- disciplinary research approaches incorporating archival, ethnographic, and relevant social science methods to the study of mass atrocities and genocide. The course will examine the epistemological and ethical aspects of these methodologies and the impacts of their findings on different audiences (academics, human rights practitioners, journalists, professionals in the diplomatic and legal realms, and the popular imagination). The course will familiarize students with different approaches to the documentation, analysis, and representation of genocide and mass atrocities through such methods as: archival practices, content analysis, qualitative interviews, the use of negative statistics, the assessment of visual materials, among others. PhD students will utilize relevant theory and methods to analyze a specific aspect of their doctoral dissertation project. MA and BA students will undertake a similar project on a topic of interest designed in consultation with the instructor. MA and BA students may instead opt for a take-home mid-term and final exam in lieu of a research project with prior permission.<br><br><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> None, though some background in human rights (history/Practice) would be helpful.<br><br><strong>Course Designation/Attribute:</strong> VP<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> Bi-annually<br><br></div>		</td>
