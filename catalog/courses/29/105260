<div><h3>PSYC 382 - Cognition in Context </h3>  <hr>The course is a capstone seminar in which participants will study cognitive processes as they unfold in contexts: the classroom, the courtroom, and COVID-19. Regarding the classroom, we will examine the factors that relate to academic achievement as they unfold in learning settings, predominantly public education classrooms. Special attention will be devoted to academically-relevant cognitive processes including executive functions, learning, and memory, as applied to content areas including reading, writing, science, and math, across the school years. The section on the courtroom will examine how laws and the US justice system relate to human cognition. This portion of the course will examine child and adolescent development, memory as relates to eye-witness testimony, bias, and systems of oppression. The final section will examine how the context of COVID is impacting cognition and cognitive development. Readings will be literature reviews, meta-analyses, perspectives pieces, and original empirical articles.<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> Bi-annually<br><br></div>		</td>
