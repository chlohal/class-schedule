<p>TOPIC SPRING 2023 - BALKAN POLITICS</p>

<p>This class explores the Balkan Area, once known as the &#8216;powder keg of Europe,&#8217; with an emphasis on history, culture, ethnic and religious conflict, institutional evolution of politics, and economic development. Because of the variety of political, historical, cultural, and even geographical interpretations, there has never been a complete agreement on what states are part of the Balkan Area. Everyone agrees that the core is formed by the newly independent states of former Yugoslavia (Serbia, Croatia Slovenia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro, North Macedonia, and Kosovo), Albania, and Bulgaria. Nevertheless, the discussion will also include Romania, Greece, and Turkey due to their unmitigated impact on the region and its history.<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> PERIODICALLY<br><br></p></div>		</td>
