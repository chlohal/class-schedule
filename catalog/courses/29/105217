<p><strong>Fall 2022: Embracing Unknowing</strong></p>

<p>&#8220;Embracing Unknowing&#8221; challenges conventional thought regarding knowledge. The class will delve into how discoveries happen: the accidental as well as the planned results. The class will explore the notion of Re-Imagining and how looking at old ideas can spur new uses and thoughts. Furthermore, the class will compare and contrast the notion of embracing not knowing an answer for some of life&#8217;s questions and being okay with the journey along the path of what we do know and what we don&#8217;t.  Embracing unknowing is a way to &#8220;think again&#8221; about what has and hasn&#8217;t happened and be more in the present.<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> Varied<br><br></p></div>		</td>
