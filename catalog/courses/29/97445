<p>Â </p>

<p>Invited and interested students are asked to identify an area of interest with an adviser and apply in writing to the department chair with a brief description of the project in the spring of their junior year. Once accepted into the Honors program, and with the adviser&#8217;s approval, students register for ENG 297 Honors in English for one credit in each of the two semesters of their senior year. The adviser and the student will agree on the project&#8217;s stages; the final thesis is due at the end of the spring semester. A second reader, chosen by the student and the adviser, participates in the final evaluation. Details are available in the handbook for English majors.<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> Every year<br><br></p></div>		</td>
