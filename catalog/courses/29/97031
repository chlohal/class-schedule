<p> Fall 2022 Topic: Renaissance Venice</p>

<p>At the beginning of the fifteenth century Venice, a unique city floating on water, was a thriving economic capital and a flourishing center of artistic production.  The only Republic in the history of the Italian peninsula which lasted until 1797 (when it was eventually conquered by Napoleon Bonaparte), Venice was the Renaissance gateway to the East and the most important European interface with the Ottoman Empire after the Fall of the Byzantine empire (1453). This class will analyze the development of Venetian art in the fifteenth and sixteenth century through the lens of artists&#8217; mobility, cross-culturality and global connections. We will focus on the evolution of devotional images (altarpieces), the &#8220;invention&#8221; of the genre of the landscape and its philosophical implications, portraiture, the role of printing, and the exchanges with Germany, Flanders and the Ottoman Empire.</p>
