<div><h3>BCMB 337 - Chemistry and Biology of Medicine </h3>  <hr>Modern medicines, ranging from anti-HIV treatments to cholesterol-lowering drugs, have become completely interwoven into society.  This course will explore a wide range of diseases and medicines with emphasis on how drugs interact with biological systems at the molecular-level to combat infections and diseases.  In addition to looking at currently available medicines, much of the course material uses recent journal articles to show examples of modern scientific reserach during the process of developing new drugs and related scientific knowledge.  This course is intended for juniros, seniors, and graduate students with strong backgrounds in both organic chemistry and biochemistry.  (Prerequisite for undergraduates are CHEM 131 and BCMB 271, with a B- minimum in each.)  Substantial class participation will be expected, and evaluations include exams, written papers, and oral presentations.<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> Spring<br><br></div>		</td>
