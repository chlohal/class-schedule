<div><h3>PSCI 173 - Latin-American Politics </h3>  <hr>As an introduction to the study of Latin-American politics, this course demands no prerequisites except a basic curiosity about the region and a desire to learn about its development over the past century. In an effort to understand contemporary politics in the region, we consider alternative theoretical explanations for patterns of development as well as analyze the historical role played by influential political actors, including the Church, the military, economic elites, workers and peasants. Some of the fundamental questions we will be asking include: What is the relationship between a country&#8217;s social and economic conditions and its political system? Why have so many Latin-American nations alternated between democratic and authoritarian regimes? What is the relationship between Latin America and the so-called &#8220;First World,&#8221; particularly the United States? In attempts to answer these questions, the course will examine the political systems of countries such as Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Mexico and Guatemala.
