<div><h3>ENG 234 - Virginia Woolf </h3>  <p><hr>Most famous as a novelist and a feminist, Virginia Woolf was also an essayist, a pacifist, a biographer, an anti-imperialist, and a diarist. In this class, we will read Woolf in multiple genres, delving into the relationship between literary form and political thought, and exploring her theorization of everyday life. As we read chronologically through her major novels and literary and cultural criticism, students will take a self-directed path through her essays and letters, highlighting connections between her life and her work, as well as recurring ideas and images. Above all, we will follow her advice on how to read a book, to &#8220;open your mind as widely as possible.&#8221;</p>
