<div><h3>HIST 239 - Special Topics Course in Global History </h3>  <p><hr>The content of this course will vary by instructor.Â  <strong>FALL 2022 TOPIC:</strong></p>

<p><em>This interdisciplinary course will examine the multifaceted roles women have played in genocidal and post-genocidal societies by conducting gendered analysis of mass atrocity. Focusing on women&#8217;s experiences during the Armenian genocide and the Holocaust, as well as the genocides in Bangladesh, Rwanda, Bosnia, and Iraq, we will analyze the relation between gender, ethnicity, class, and violence, since this intersectionality plays a crucial role in the way women experience genocide. We will explore the voices of female victims, and perpetrators, eyewitnesses, and relief workers drawing upon a number of important primary and secondary sources, analyzing memoirs, and diaries, reading novels, and viewing and discussing documentary films.</em></p>

<p><em>This course may be repeated for credit two times.</em><br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> Every other year<br><br></p></div>		</td>
