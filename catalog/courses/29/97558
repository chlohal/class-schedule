<div><h3>GEOG 141 - Research Design and Methods in Geography </h3>  <p><hr>Focuses on ways in which empirical geographic research is conducted. Students study problems, methodological strategies and analytical techniques characteristic of current research in human and/or environmental geography and spatial science. Includes defining a research problem, research design, approaches to sampling and measurement, analysis, interpretation and writeup. As a building block of geographic and human-environment research, GEOG 141 is a required skills course in the Geography major, and strongly recommended for the GES major. All Geography majors are required to take the research methods course in the Geography department; substitution requests for GEOG 141 will be granted only in exceptional circumstances, after consultation with the major advisor, and with adequate justification.</p>

<p>Must register for discussion; recommended for sophomores.<br><br><strong>Course Designation/Attribute:</strong> FA<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> Offered every year<br><br></p></div>		</td>
