<div><h3>MPA 3050 - Cultural Competence </h3>  <hr>This course is designed for students to examine their personal and professional understanding of cultural competency within work, school, home and community spaces. We will use class discussions, group activities, videos, journals, and student presentations to increase understanding of how Ethnicity, Gender, Race, Sexual Orientation, Racial Identity, and Religion play a part in developing a cultural competent mindset. Using the 6 Levels of Cultural Competence, students will examine the historical context of oppression especially in the US. Through further analyses of their spaces, students will develop personal and professional action steps. At the end of the course, students will have a cultural toolbox and lens to navigate the increasingly multicultural and multiethnic community.<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> Annually<br><br></div>		</td>
