<div><h3>HS 012 - Mindful Choices </h3>  <p><hr>What holds my attention, and calls for me to explore it further? What do I enjoy, and what do I care most about? Where do I find a sense of meaning and purpose?</p>

<p>How do my interests and concerns relate to the choices I am making in my education? Do I listen well to what my intuition is telling me about my life choices? How do I visualize myself participating in our society and world when I graduate?</p>

<p>Students are invited to explore and reflect on these questions in an art-making course called Mindful Choices. This guided experience will offer students a chance to engage in creative practice and reflection as they consider paths of study at this important juncture of their undergraduate career, and encourage a more conscious commitment to the direction of their education. The process of exploration and discernment will be supported through artistic practice in the visual arts, music or creative writing. Please be advised, similar to most courses, this course is not repeatable for credit.</p>

<p>Students will receive a half-credit for the course, which is pass/fail.</p>
