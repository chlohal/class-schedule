<div><h3>FILM 1150 - Exploring Hispanic Culture </h3>  <hr>The Hispanic culture is rich and vibrant and we will come to a greater appreciation and understanding of it through an examination of its literature, poetry and films. The films we will view will be both popular and famous in Latin America and Spain and our readings will be from writers, contemporary and historic, that are well known not only in their own country but around the world (Isabel Allende, Vargas llosa, Gracia Lorca, Cervantes, etc.). Through our assignments there will be an opportunity for us to participate in a more in depth study of various aspects of Hispanic culture and traditions. By the end of the semester you will have acquired a greater understanding, interpretation and response to the Hispanic culture.<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> various<br><br></div>		</td>
