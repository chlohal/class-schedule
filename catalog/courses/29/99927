<div><h3>MCA 281 - Urban Community Journalism </h3>  <p><hr>This class represents a melding of practical and academic approaches to journalism and combines the knowledge on the street with the knowledge of the academy and high level journalism.   Students will connect regularly to the local community and produce publishable products.</p>

<p>After several weeks devoted to reporting skills, this class will turn its focus to the city of Worcester and the Telegram and Gazette newspaper as representatives of urban America and urban journalism.  The class will meet four or five times at the newspaper (transportation provided) to speak with the editors and reporters in business, criminal justice, sports, and the arts.</p>

<p>As part of their work, students will write two stories based on their reporting on the Worcester community, with the aim of publishing them in the Telegram and Gazette.  Note that this part of the course will require time off campus (again, transportation will be provided).</p>
