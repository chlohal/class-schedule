<div><h3>ENG 111 - Creative Writing:  Nonfiction </h3>  <p><hr>True stories, well told. Creative nonfiction is like jazz-a mix of flavors, ideas, techniques. Some are new; others as old as writing itself. We are story, essay, journal article, research paper, reported journalism, memoir, even poem; personal or not, or all of the above. In this course, we will read examples and tell our own stories as well as other people&#8217;s. We&#8217;ll operate in part as a studio devoted to writing; we&#8217;ll discuss what we read and explore craft and technique. We will workshop our own work. Students submit a final publication-ready portfolio. This course counts towards the Creative Writing minor. It does not count towards the English major or English minor.</p>
