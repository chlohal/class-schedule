<div><h3>ENG 090 - Technology, Personhood, and the Future </h3>  <hr>Speculative fiction serves as a vital tool for investigating the contemporary issues we face both as individuals and as a community. In this course, we take up questions and concerns surrounding technology. Technology impact human life in a myriad of ways. It shapes our health, finances, culture, climate, and lifestyle. Technology informs the ways in which we conceptual what it is to a person and the character of our society. We will examine works of science fiction literature as a vehicle for exploring the way technology influences us now and ways it might influence us in the<br>
future. Particular topics we address include questions about artificial intelligence, artificial life, the nature of virtual reality, the effects of technology on our biology, psychology, government, and environment. This is a Clark Commons course for first-year students only. It is an interdisciplinary, team-taught course that approaches a &#8220;big topic&#8221; from multiple disciplinary lenses andÂ  methodologies.
