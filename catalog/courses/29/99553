<div><h3>EDUC 291 - An Exploration of Multicultural Children&#8217;s and Young Adult Literature </h3>  <p><hr>Students will read, discuss, and analyze multicultural literature for children by and about people of diverse backgrounds including diversity in race, ethnicity, class, gender, sexual orientation, language, and country. A particular ethnic (or other group) focus may be emphasized for in-depth study. Books examined will include picture books, realistic fiction, non-fiction, biographies, memoirs, verse novels, graphic novels, science fiction, fairy tales, fantasy, and wordless books. While multicultural literature written for children will comprise the primary texts in this course, secondary sources from education, linguistics, English, history, sociology, anthropology, critical race theory, women&#8217;s studies and communications will provide context and theory to guide analysis.</p>
