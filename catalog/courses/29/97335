<div><h3>EDUC 304 - Teaching as Research Seminar I </h3>  <hr>This seminar brings together urban-school teachers (at the elementary, middle, and secondary level) with undergraduate students and faculty involved the Next Generation Science Exemplar (NGSX) project.  The seminar supports teachers and teacher leaders to reflect on their own practice, as they develop capacity to lead their own NGSX Study groups, while participating in university-based and practitioner-based educational research. The seminar focuses on qualitative, sociolinguistic research in classrooms, emphasizing the study of talk and texts as a vehicle for better understanding students&#8217; learning, developing systematic techniques for describing and critiquing classroom activities, and supporting effective learning among a socioculturally diverse population of students. Participants meet in facilitated groups to carry out qualitative research on their own practice and develop forums through which their work can be disseminated to a wider community of teachers and researchers.  By permission only.<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> Offered periodically<br><br></div>		</td>
