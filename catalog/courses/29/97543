<div><h3>GEOG 052 - Global Change, Regional Challenges </h3>  <hr>Applies a regional perspective to explore important questions related to our planet and its people including: What are the key challenges facing communities, environments and societies in different regions of the world today? Is the world becoming more culturally homogenous or more fragmented? Why is the global distribution of wealth so uneven and how might poorer regions &#8220;catch up&#8221; to wealthier regions? How does the physical and human context of a region influence its ability to benefit from globalization? What factors are driving regional conflicts and how might peaceful resolutions be achieved? Focuses on eight regions - Europe, Russia/Central Asia, Middle East, Sub-Saharan Africa, Latin America, East Asia, and South/Southeast Asia. One or two significant issues will be focused on in each region such as gender equality, human rights, environmental sustainability, political change, economic development, public health, and/or human rights.<br><br><strong>Course Designation/Attribute:</strong> GP<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> Offered every year<br><br></div>		</td>
