<div><h3>HGS 110 - Antisemitism and Racism in the Modern World </h3>  <hr>Discourse about antisemitism have proliferated in the last decades, so have violent killings of Jewish and other minority communities. But what is antisemitism? Is antisemitism a specific perception of Jews, as some claim or is antisemitism &#8220;just&#8221; another form of racism? Is antisemitism grounded in anything real, such as religious difference? And is racism simply an irrational fear of visible difference? Relatedly, is racism a general form of hatred and prejudice while antisemitism is a specific one? What are the social mechanism of racism and antisemitism? Are they similar and comparable? What are they based on, given that they often operate independent of the target groups actions? This course takes a comparative approach in demonstrating how social mechanisms of exclusion, inequality and race-craft emerged, changed, yet still organize contemporary societies around the figure of the Jew and other minorities.<br><br><strong>Course Designation/Attribute:</strong> VP, DI<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> Spring 2022<br><br></div>		</td>
