<div><h3>GEOG 350 - Global Political Ecology </h3>  <hr>This seminar examines the field of political ecology from a global perspective and with emphasis on the role of critical human and physical geography in its development.Â We read &#8220;classic&#8221; books and influential articles that provoked debates and shaped the field over the past several decades, as well as more recent texts in the cutting edge of the field. We also study non-Anglophone political ecologies, and the &#8220;Clark School of Political Ecology&#8221; to which we ourselves belong.<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> Annually<br><br></div>		</td>
