<div><h3>ES 1210 - Journey to Sustainability </h3>  <hr>&#8220;Journey to Sustainability&#8221; is designed for people interested in learning about the concept of sustainability and why sustainability is important for human survival. Simply put, is sustainability still possible, given that seven billion people are living on the planet? While this question may seem scary, the main goal of this course is to leave you with a feeling of hope for our environmental future. We will begin with a basic background in ecology and Earth&#8217;s systems. This background will provide the tools needed in order to develop one&#8217;s own conclusions when learning about current issues in environmental science. The second part of this course will focus on current environmental issues, which are mostly a result of humans using natural resources unsustainably. Issues studied will include climate change, overfishing, pollution, and energy. The last part of this course will focus on creating individual sustainability goals and assessing the current state of the planet.<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> various<br><br></div>		</td>
