<div><h3>PSCI 233 - THE ARAB SPRING AND ITS AFTERMATH </h3>  <p><hr>This course explores contentious politics and political violence in the modern Middle East. It focuses on the causes and consequences of the series of popular uprisings that broke out across the Arab world in 2011, collectively known as &#8220;the Arab Spring,&#8221; and the civil wars and failed democratic transitions which followed. Drawing on the academic research on contentious politics, democratic transitions, and civil war, we will examine the grievances that mobilized the uprisings, the actors who participated in them, and the responses of the governments across the region. We will also seek to understand the long-term consequences of the Arab Spring for the future of the Middle East.</p>

<p>Introduction to Comparative Politics (070) or Politics of the Middle East (174) are recommended but not required.<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> BI-ANNUALLY - EVERY OTHER YEAR<br><br></p></div>		</td>
