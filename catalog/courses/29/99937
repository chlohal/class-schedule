<div><h3>MSPC 3220 - Effective Communication </h3>  <hr>Communicating clearly and effectively is critical for success. It comes down to storytelling through different modalities. We break down the skills for communicating   starting with observation, mindfulness and critical thinking, and getting your creative ideas into your chosen medium. This includes understanding and putting into practice key disciplines for mastering communications that will move your audience. You will hear presentations from successful writers, but the heart of this course is one-on-one mentoring through regular prose-writing exercises. These include advocacy, business, marketing, grant writing, as well as social media and literary styles. You will come away with an understanding of your own communication style and how to make it take flight. <br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> Varied<br><br></div>		</td>
