<div><h3>ENG 202 - Imagining Place: Writing Health, Science and the Environment </h3>  <p><hr>An in-depth introduction to narrative writing with a focus upon environmental science, social justice and public health. We will explore the history of nature writing and look at writing as action in the age of climate change. Using multidisciplinary frameworks, we will reconsider our position in relation to the natural world and our current epoch. We have a real world project to discover as well: one of the largest toxic dumps in the country was &#8220;cleaned up&#8221; with $55 million but many in the community are sick and health markers are elevated. In this class, we produce four pieces of narrative, and in the process discover how the writing voice acquires authority built on documentation and research. We will explore genre, voice, audience and technique in a variety of academic and professional exercises, and introduce elements of multi-source, sound storytelling-using the creative non-fiction approach, scene work, observation, exposition, transition and subtext. This course counts towards the Creative Writing minor.</p>
