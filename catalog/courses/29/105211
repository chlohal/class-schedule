<div><h3>GEOG 328 - Hydroclimatology </h3>  <hr><span style="color:rgb(0,0,0);float:none;font-family:'times new roman';font-size:medium;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;text-indent:0px;">This course is a general introduction to climatology and the interaction between earth&#8217;s climate and the hydrologic cycle. We will emphasize the essential controls of weather and climate, patterns and dynamics of the global climate (including insolation, temperature, evapotranspiration, precipitation, and atmospheric circulation), and the drivers of climate and hydrologic change. We will examine large-scale modes of climate variability (such as the El Ni√±o-Southern Oscillation), as well as hydroclimate extremes (droughts, floods). Finally, the course will have a focus on developing a deeper understanding of how climate data are collected, analyzed, and disseminated, and how models have become important tools to improve our understanding of these systems.</span><br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> Annually<br><br></div>		</td>
