<div><h3>MPA 3110 - Applied GIS For Decision Makers </h3>  <hr>GIS technology is a computer-based tool that unites previously unrelated information into easily understood maps allowing decision-makers to virtually see the issues before them and to select the best course of action. Integrated with the Internet, GIS offers a consistent and cost-effective way for the sharing and analysis of geographic data among government agencies, private industry, non-profit organizations, and the general public.<br>
This lecture/lab based course has been designed with an emphasis on applied learning appropriate for public or nonprofit agency activities. This course is designed for those who do not have a GIS background.  Although the course is computer intensive, no mapping or programming background is required.<br>
