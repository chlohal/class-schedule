<div><h3>MPA 3116 - International Organizations </h3>  <p><hr>State and local administrators around the world interact with international organizations on a daily basis for policy implementation, organizational performance, and monitoring of institutions.  This course analyzes international organizations in terms of politics, economics, and culture with a focus on the United Nations, the European Union, the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, and military organizations like NATO.  This course also describes how Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs) influence policy making for state and local administrators.   In the face of increasing nationalism across the world, this course will also ask the question of whether &#8220;global governance&#8221; is possible and/or desirable?</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Student learning outcomes include learning the institutional structure, mandates, and jurisdiction of international organizations.  Students learn how NGOs impact local policy-making and see how cultural and political regime differences among administrators are reflected in the collaborations with international organizations.  Deliverables would be a case study analysis of a specific international organization or a comparative analysis of different international organizations and their ability to influence or govern local conditions.</p>
