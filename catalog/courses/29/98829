<div><h3>UDSC 245 - Going Local: Community Development and Planning </h3>  <hr>The purpose of this seminar is to introduce students to theories, debates and practical strategies regarding the development of urban communities. Students gain an enhanced understanding of the complexities inherent to the concepts of community and participation. They critically analyze &#8220;community&#8221; as a set of social relations, as a local economy, as a built environment, and as a political organization. Students begin to recognize the importance of race, gender, age, class, identity, and culture in working with communities. Finally, they examine the roles and effectiveness of the methods, models and strategies used by informal neighborhood organizations, banks, private developers, local nonprofits, and government agencies in rebuilding communities and their economies. Case examples and articles from across the United States will be used. Worcester&#8217;s neighborhoods-which provide excellent examples of physical, social, and economic development strategies-will be highlighted throughout this course.<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> Fall<br><br></div>		</td>
