<div><h3>SOC 255 - The Creation of Nationalism, Nationalist Cultures and Symbols </h3>  <hr>Nationalism has grown dramatically in the contemporary period, especially in the recent past when lethal and violent forms of ultra-right nationalisms have emerged. This course explores the symbols (i.e., both as related to language and material culture) and the cultural values that are activated to create and define nationalist cultures. Which &#8220;imagined communities,&#8221; &#8220;invented traditions,&#8221; and &#8220;symbolic economies&#8221; are generated to operationalize nationalist cultures? We interrogate the consumer commodities, cultural symbols, and dress codes that accord heightened significance and to nationalist cultures.<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> Offered every other year<br><br></div>		</td>
