<div><h3>JS 118 - Introduction to the Hebrew Bible II: Prophecy and Poetry </h3>  <hr>A close reading (in English) of the poetic portions of the Hebrew Bible, from Isaiah through the Writings. The prophetic revolution in Israel is evaluated: its roots, as well as its impact on its own society and later social and cultural criticism in the West. The artistry of biblical poetry is analyzed, along with the thematics of piety, despair, resignation and eroticism that are found in such books as the Psalms and the Song of Songs. Finally, books of a more philosophical bent (Ecclesiastes, Job), which question the earlier assumptions of biblical faith, are read.
