<div><h3>SOC 254 - Class and Status in Black American Life </h3>  <hr>This course will explore the class and status hierarchies among Black Americans from slavery to the present. Centered on the classic works of W.E.B. Du Bois and E. Franklin Frazier, as well as contemporary research by Karyn Lacy and Mary Pattillo, we will examine the class composition of this group during three periods of American history: slavery, Jim Crow, and post-civil rights. In addition to addressing factors that shaped class formation, we will examine how class and status positions of Black Americans changed and/or remained stagnant over time. How class interacts with skin color, gender, the criminal justice system, and sexuality will be given special consideration. In combination, we will have the knowledge to critically analyze how obscuring class diversity among Black Americans has contributed to the persistence of anti-Black sentiment in the United States.<br><br><strong>Course Designation/Attribute:</strong> DI<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> Annually<br><br></div>		</td>
