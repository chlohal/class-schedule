<div><h3>PSCI 217 - Latino Politics in the U.S. </h3>  <p><hr>Over 50 million Latinos reside in the United States today, making them the largest minority group in the country. The current population size, projected growth trajectory, and population density of Latinos in many political battleground states have made this group a favored topic among politicians, interest groups and mass media. Moreover, recent elections and public policy debates demonstrate the capacity of this community as a political force. Yet, what do we really know about the politics and opinions associated with the diverse and fast-growing Latino population? How are Latinos incorporated into American political life?  What difference does it make to be of Latino descent in the U.S.?  How and why are Latinos distinctive in their political attitudes and behaviors?  This course presents an in-depth examination of this important population</p>
