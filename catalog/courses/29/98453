<div><h3>PSYC 387 - Ethics and Professional Issues in Clinical Psychology </h3>  <hr>This course addresses a range of ethical and professionals issues faced by clinical psychologists. Among the questions that we grapple with are, What constitutes confidentiality in therapeutic relationships? How do the ethical guidelines regarding confidentiality differ for adults versus minors? What is the duty to warn and when is it necessary? What are common ethical dilemmas in the initiation and termination of therapeutic relationships with mental health consumers? What are the tensions between ethical standards in clinical research versus clinical practice? How do psychologists manage complex professional issues such as multiple roles, determining and practicing within the boundaries of clinical competence, and recognizing and addressing professional misconduct in the workplace? For first-year clinical students.<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> Offered every year<br><br></div>		</td>
