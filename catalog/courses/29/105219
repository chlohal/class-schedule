<p>FALL 2022 Topic: Intro to Legal Studies - This course will provide students with an in depth understanding of the American legal system.  Beginning with the philosophical underpinnings of the law, students will gain an appreciation for how our courts are structured and how they have evolved over time.  We will also spend time discussing substantive areas of law (torts, contracts, criminal law etc.) in order to provide an introduction to the traditional law school experience. <br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> Varied<br><br></p></div>		</td>
