We will address career readiness competencies, specifically that of <em>self-development</em>, and Problems of Practice methods to design a path of successful academic and personal engagement at Clark and beyond.</p>

<p>Interdisciplinary readings will span literature, philosophy, psychology and be literary, nonfiction, and scientific in nature. Various learning methods will be used including mindfulness practices, reflective writing, small-group dialogue circles, and other student-centered, team building activities. Students will engage with DOC staff, peers, and faculty and community partners in discovering pathways toward enrichment and involvement. All will be approached through a lens of equity and inclusion regarding the selection of course materials, teachers, and visitors to ensure a compassionate, intimate setting where students from different demographics are given equal voice in dialogue to explore the following questions:</p>

<p><em>How can mindfulness and reflection benefit my wellbeing, my intentions, and my actions toward academic and career exploration?</em> <em>Who am I and what strengths and gifts do I offer?
