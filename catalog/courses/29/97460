<div><h3>ENG 353 - Advanced Studies in Shakespeare </h3>  <p><hr>&#8220;Shakespeare and Race&#8221;</p>

<p>Race and racism are not inventions exclusive to the modern age. The problem runs much deeper, and much earlier. This Shakespeare seminar examines how language and power influence emerging notions of racial difference, particularly Whiteness and Blackness, in the early modern world. In addition to reading and writing about Shakespeare&#8217;s works in their context, the seminar explores theory and recent studies in critical race studies, disability studies, Black feminist theory, border studies, sexuality studies, postcolonial studies, and more that allow us to understand and critique the place of Shakespeare in our world today. We will also center literature and drama by writers of color that speak back to Shakespeare and complicate both his and our notions of race and ethnicity. This course builds on introductory knowledge of Shakespeare and/or general English literary history.<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> Periodically<br><br></p></div>		</td>
