This course will examine the basic applications of biological and chemical sciences to crime scene investigation. Specific topics may include analysis of physical evidence (i.e. fingerprinting, hair analysis, fiber analysis), principles of serology and blood analysis. DNA analysis, ballistics, drug detection and toxicology, as well as chemical separation and identification techniques. Famous cases will be reviewed, such as the John F. Kennedy assassination, the deaths of celebrities such as Heath Ledger and Anna Nicole Smith, the O.J. Simpson Trial, the case of Dr. Sam Sheppard, and the identity of Anastasia. An interactive laboratory will mirror the work of a crime lab with emphasis on collection of evidence and hands-on experience with experimental techniques used to solve crimes.<br><br><strong>Course Designation/Attribute:</strong> SP<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> Offered every other year<br><br></div>		</td>
