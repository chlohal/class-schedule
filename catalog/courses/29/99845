<p>Intersession 2020 - Topic: CYBER LAW AND POLICY</p>

<p>Changes in technology, especially changes in the technology of communication, have historically been a kind of &#8220;stress test&#8221; on the law.  As the internet, and digital technologies of all kinds, have become an integral part of society, the legal system continues to struggle with fundamental questions such as: How much should the operators of Facebook, YouTube, Reddit, Yelp, or similar sites be responsible for content?; Does the First Amendment require that pornography be widely available on the Internet (and does it require that we tolerate &#8220;revenge porn&#8221; as well)?; Should we really have an expectation of privacy in personal data we freely share with Instagram and our cell phone provider?; How can the value of copyright be protected when anyone can distribute perfect digital copies of music and video to the whole world?  These and similar questions will be discussed in this course through a review of the legislation and case law that define the ever shifting legal boundaries of the digital world.</p>

<p>Fall 2020 Semester Topic: AMERICAN CONSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT</p>

<p>The current constitutional order represents a series of arrangements that have often been the result of countless legal and political decisions.  While courts and judges play a critical role shaping their development, they are also influenced by political actors, as well, such as executives and legislators - both at the national and state level- parties, social movements, public opinion, and so forth.  The course covers the intricacies of American constitutionalism and its institutional framework, including the framing of the Constitution in 1787, the development of the three branches, and the evolution of federalism.  By gaining a better appreciation of the broader legal and political context of these changes, we shall address the proper role of the Supreme Court in a representative democracy, the purview of legislatures and voters, the balance between the president and Congress, and the relationship between the federal government and the states.  <br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> PERIODICALLY<br><br></p></div>		</td>
