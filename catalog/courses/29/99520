<div><h3>PSYC 040 - Topics in Discourse </h3>  <p><hr>Through class exercises and small group work, we will learn fundamental principles, generalizations, and theories in a new area of knowledge around issues of language/discourse. The topics in discourse will vary each semester based on current and relevant issues.</p>

<p><u><strong>Fall 2021:</strong></u></p>

<p><strong>1) Maori language and culture and 2) friendship:</strong></p>

<p>In two strands running parallel throughout the semester, we will jointly learn Maori and explore how we talk about ourselves and others as friends &#8211; and make sense of friendship as an intimate relationship. In individual projects, we will be interviewing three members of the same family (adolescent, adult, and elderly) on their friendship experiences, and we will analyze these experiences through the Language and Culture Perspective. Students are expected to commit themselves to a high-level academic atmosphere and a challenging workload that will result in stimulating class discussions. Enrolled students must register for a discussion section, and participation in a weekend session is required.<br><br><strong>Course Designation/Attribute:</strong> LP<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> Fall<br><br></p></div>		</td>
