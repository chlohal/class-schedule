<div><h3>WGS 110 - Introduction to Women&#8217;s and Gender Studies </h3>  <p><hr>In this course we will explore the ways in which ideas about femininity and masculinity have shaped women&#8217;s lives-locally and globally, in the present and historically-and how some women have challenged, even transformed, those meanings and the social relationships that flow from those two potent ideas. Among the topics that may be considered are: beauty, war, sports, politics, women&#8217;s movements, sexuality, race, work, violence, fashion, family, globalization, feminism, creativity, religion, media and girlhood.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> WGS 110 is open to all students in all majors. The content varies by semester, reflecting the instructor&#8217;s individual field of study and expertise. As an introductory course, preference is given to incoming first-year students and students entering their sophomore year. Juniors and seniors may register only by permission of the instructor.<br>
