<div><h3>HIST 253 - Beauty, Gender, and Power around the World, 1800 to the Present </h3>  <hr>This course examines changing and multifaceted beauty standards around the world (Asia, Europe, America, Africa, and Oceania) with the aim of deconstructing them in order to understand the power dynamics embedded in ideal appearances.  Positioning beauty at the intersection of race, gender, and sexuality, we will examine its construction through political and cultured readings on the meanings of body parts and body languages (i.e. hair, face, teeth, skin, smile, and feet).  This course encourages students to problematize contemporary beauty templates in various countries and cultures.  We will also use our examination of beauty as a way to further develop student&#8217;s skills in historical research, reasoning, and writing.<br><br><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Course open to junior and senior students only.<br><br><strong>Course Designation/Attribute:</strong> DI<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> Annually<br><br></div>		</td>
