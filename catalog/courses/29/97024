<div><h3>ARTH 210 - The Art of Art History: Teaching and Methods </h3>  <hr>This seminar and practicum is the capstone experience for majors in art history. Students enrolled in this course will serve as PLAs (Peer Learning Assistants) for the art history survey, Arth 010, Stone Age to Our Age. This seminar has two primary goals:1) to explore some of the major critical questions that art historians have asked, and attempted to answer, about our discipline; and 2) to provide guidance and critical support for teaching art history discussion sections. Among the questions that our seminar readings will address: how do we talk and write about art, which is by definition non-verbal, and how do we help others learn to talk and write about art? What is the influence of social and political context on a work of art, and how can we guide others to an appropriate use of this historical information? What makes for an effective discussion group experience?<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> Offered every semester<br><br></div>		</td>
