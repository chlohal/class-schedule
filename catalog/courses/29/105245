However, it is impossible to meaningfully discuss technology without understanding how it works. This course teaches introductory computer programming and other relevant computing skills. No prior experience with computer programming is expected. Upon completing this course, you will have a solid understanding of how computer programs are created and how information is stored digitally. You will also have developed opinions about digital privacy, technological bias, and other matters of critical importance to society<br><br><strong>Course Designation/Attribute:</strong> FA, DI<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> Annually or Each Semester<br><br></div>		</td>
