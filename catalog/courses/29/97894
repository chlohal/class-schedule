<div><h3>IDCE 334 - Planning and Zoning for Community Developers </h3>  <hr>This master&#8217;s-level course introduces students to the field of planning and zoning for community development. The student will be exposed to a wide range of methods used in planning, while also taking into account some of the challenges inherent in their use. The course work helps students understand the city, imagine the future, and move to action, while building skills in writing, oral, and graphic communication, research and analysis, and team work. This course helps prepare students to join the planning profession or learn how to navigate it in other roles. Students are introduced to the broad scope of the professional field, which involves different functional topics, scales, and sectors. The course work focuses on the practical application of planning theory, with case studies and hands on experience to understand the implications of analysis, the different types of plan-making, and the role of implementation.  This course fulfills requirements for skills and methods across all IDCE programs and can also serve as a concentration elective in Urban Resilience.  <br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> Fall<br><br></div>		</td>
