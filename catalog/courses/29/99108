<div><h3>SCRN 209 - Genre Production Workshop </h3>  <p><hr>This digital filmmaking course is offered as an advanced level production workshop primarily for Visual and Performing Arts students in their junior or senior years. It builds upon the foundations of cinematic analysis and practice established in the first few years of the Screen major sequence, as well as the introductory sequences of the other programs in the department: Music, Theater, Studio Art, Art History, and MCA. Enrolled students from diverse backgrounds in the arts will work collectively on a single original short film project. The project will showcase each student&#8217;s disciplinary training in areas such as directing, producing, acting, cinematography, production design, editing, original music, and sound design. With an equal emphasis placed on theory and practice, this film production workshop employs hands-on demonstrations, screenings, readings, lectures, discussions, and peer-based critiques to assist students in the creative process. Classes stress research, form, style, and technique as integral components of creative inter-media practice</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Note: The genre focus each term may vary.  The topic for Spring 2023 is Film Noir.  Enrollment is subject to professor approval; interested students should email the professor.</p>

<p>    </p>

<p>Students will be charged a V &amp; PA lab fee upon registering for this course.</p>
