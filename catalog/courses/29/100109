<div><h3>CMLT 160 - Wayfaring, Wayfinding? Wandering in French-Speaking Societies </h3>  <hr>Seeking, fleeing. What motivates our movements, from daily displacements to continent crossings? Wandering, wondering. How are these travels experienced, mentally and physically? How are these travels told, represented in literature and film? Encountering, examining, questing, questioning. What is society&#8217;s view of wandering, of the wanderer? Free-spirited rebel, the embodiment of liberty? Or vagrant, outcast, for whom society has no place? In this course, we will investigate the act of wandering - its forms and functions, its representation in the 20th and 21st-century francophone literature, film, and social sciences. We will examine writing and thinking with regards to movement, as mental and physical act; we will consider francophone texts of wandering and the ways in which some texts, themselves, wander from convention. All readings and discussions in English.<br><br><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> P=IDND018 or VE Placement<br><br><strong>Course Designation/Attribute:</strong> VE<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> Bi-annually<br><br></div>		</td>
