<div><h3>PSYC 080 - Zen and the Psychology of Contemplative Practice </h3>  <p><hr>This FYI will examine contemplative practice as it is represented both within modern Western Zen traditions and the recent explosion of psychological research in cognitive neuroscience, affective science, and clinical psychology on mindfulness meditation. Emphasis will be placed on the practice of meditation, the history and origins of mindfulness practices, the scientific study of those practices, and adaptations of mindfulness practices by Western scientists for the treatment of psychological disorders and enhancement of well-being.</p>

<p>Key questions this course will address include: 1) What is a contemplative practice and how is it practiced? 2) How does mindfulness influence psychological well-being? 3) What are the historical origins of mindfulness practices and how have such practices been adapted in the West? 3) How does Western empirical inquiry inform our understanding of mindfulness and its measurable effects?</p>
