<div><h3>TA 215 - Stage Combat </h3>  <p><hr>This class will offer an introduction to stage combat, a vocabulary, a process and a basis for safe exploration of violent action in theater. The first three weeks will be spent on hand-to-hand basics: shared weight improvisation, tumbling (the safe way to fall), learning moves, positions and reactions. The second three weeks will focus on learning the basics of weapons fighting. Using wooden dowels as weapons, we will cover the basics of footwork and hand positions in Staff fighting, Broadsword, Rapier and Dagger, and Small Sword. In latter classes, students will work on implementing techniques into a complete fight. Limited to 12 Theatre majors, non-majors require permission.</p>

<p>Students will be charged a V &amp; PA lab fee upon registering for this course.<br><br><strong>Course Designation/Attribute:</strong> AP<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> Offered every year<br><br></p></div>		</td>
