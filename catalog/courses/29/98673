<div><h3>ENG 338 - Contemporary Latino/a Literature </h3>  <hr>This course examines the contributions to American literature made by Chicanos, Puerto Ricans, Cubans, Dominicans and other Latino/Latina writers in the United States over the last thirty years.  Through a variety of Latino/Latina writing, we will explore the ways in which these writers represent community, class, race, gender, culture, nation, and ethnicity in their works.  We will also examine the ways in which Latinas(os) have manufactured identities within mainstream society, as well as the development of cultural hybrids and other forms of cultural registers.  Representative works of various genres will be read and analyzed within a cultural context;  the testimonio, the auto ethnographic essay, the narrative (novel and short story), drama, poetry and film.  Authors include Gloria Anzaldua, Sandra Cisneros, Luis Valdez, Cristina Garcia, Julia Alvarez, Junot Diaz, Achy Obejas and Piri Thomas<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> Every year<br><br></div>		</td>
