Humbert, Clarissa Dalloway-what makes a character memorable? This course is a deep dive into<br>
creating dynamic characters. After all, characters are both the seed and the vehicle for a story. We will<br>
build characters layer by layer, considering motivation, backstory, conflict, point of view, and voice.<br>
We will also &#8220;read as writers&#8221; to unpack examples of particularly lively characters. Classes will be<br>
taught in seminar fashion and will include a combination of writing exercises, short lectures, class<br>
discussion, and workshops. You will also learn how to submit your work to literary journals. The final<br>
consists of revised creative work. This course counts toward the Creative Writing minor.<br><br><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> IDND 018 or VE Placement<br><br><strong>Course Designation/Attribute:</strong> D&I, AP<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> Annually.<br><br></div>		</td>
