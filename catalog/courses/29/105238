<div><h3>ID 109 - Climate and Conflict: Understanding Violence in the Anthropocene </h3>  <hr>Conflict is worsened by climate change, and conflict / violence contributes to climate change (e.g., deforestation, sabotaging oil infrastructure, resource pressures associated with large-scale displacement). Yet, there is no simple &#8220;climate wars&#8221; explanation for these connections. This interdisciplinary course facilitates students&#8217; investigation of the intersections between climate change and conflict and introduces the multiple lens of violence (direct, structural and cultural). Lecturers introduce students to key principles and practices to study particular dimensions of climate change via topics such as mass violence and genocide, forced migration, natural resource conflicts, climate change denial, environmental activism, indigeneity, environmental justice, and development. Students will engage in comparative and interdisciplinary analysis of the relationship between climate change, conflict and violence, which culminates in a final project design that helps each student think about how they wish to respond to such a challenge. A global perspective is taken, focusing on cases in North America, and Saharan and sub-Saharan Africa.<br><br><strong>Course Designation/Attribute:</strong> VP<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> Annually<br><br></div>		</td>
