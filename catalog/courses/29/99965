<div><h3>ENT 211 - Creating a Movement </h3>  <p><hr>Successful implementation of change, whether it is entrepreneurship (as in the adoption of a new product or service), or social innovation (people coming together to make a positive impact) involves having people join and support you towards a common goal, or movement. This course is designed to develop your understanding of the decision-making process involved when people decide to buy a product or join a movement. This problem-based course allows you, the student, to bridge the theory/practice divide by developing real solutions, which are tested using the following tools; empathy mapping, customer adopting behavior, and interview guide.Â </p>

<p>This course, in combination with ENT211 Marketing to You, can be used as an elective for the Marketing major and ENT minor.</p>
