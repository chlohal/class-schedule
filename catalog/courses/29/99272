<div><h3>PHIL 290 - Capstone in Philosophy </h3>  <p><hr>The capstone course is offered to all senior philosophy majors and satisfies the Capstone requirement for the major. Particular topics vary from year to year, but each instance of the capstone course focuses on some particular advanced area of philosophical literature. Typically, students spend the first quarter of the semester engaged in a sustained, scholarly examination of core texts. For the remainder of the semester, students pursue their own lines of inquiry concerning the subject area by working on a research paper. Course requirements include presentations of one&#8217;s ongoing work to other students and a final capstone paper.Â  Students must be seniors and philosophy majors.</p>
