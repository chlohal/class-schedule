<div><h3>MUSC 119 - Hip Hop & Social Identity </h3>  <hr>Our identities come from our lived experiences. As hip hop is the expression of lived experience,<br>
it is also the expression of individual and shared identities. In this class, students will explore<br>
how hip hop, an art form originally from the Bronx, NY c. 1970, shapes and depicts various<br>
social identities. We will investigate how hip hop gives voice to an individual&#8217;s race, religion,<br>
ethnicity, gender, and sexuality. We will also question how a hip-hop artist&#8217;s self-expression<br>
intersects and merges with the identities of their listeners. A community-based learning project<br>
will allow students to both learn about and participate in their local hip hop scene of Worcester.<br><br><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Any MUSC course or MCA 101<br><br><strong>Course Designation/Attribute:</strong> DI<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> Periodically<br><br></div>		</td>
