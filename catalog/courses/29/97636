<div><h3>GEOG 380 - Urban Ecology: Cities as Ecosystems </h3>  <hr>Explores ecology and the social and physical geography of cities as systems built and inhabited by people, and constantly changed by social, biological and physical processes. This class of ecosystem is often neglected except in studies of pollution, yet it is home to many of the world&#8217;s people and to a surprising number of plant and animal species as well. Readings, lectures, discussion and written work combine landscape and systems ecology with physical and urban geography and environmental justice to broaden our understanding of city environments, both present and possible. In addition to our in-class academic meetings, field trips in Worcester and the surrounding Blackstone River Valley will offer a deep dive into the challenges of regional and historical land use, urban green and blue space management, and socio-hydrology; a $100 fee is charged to students at time of registration to cover administrative and transportation costs. Book costs for the course are minimal. Registration is by Permission only for undergraduates (email: rroychowdhury@clarku.edu).<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> Offered every year<br><br></div>		</td>
