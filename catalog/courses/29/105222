<div><h3>PHIL 115 - Sexism and Misogyny - Current Readings in Feminist Philosophy </h3>  <hr>What are sexism and misogyny and how do they operate? What tools does feminism provide to address sexism and<br>
misogyny? How are sexism and misogyny related to other social problems such as racism, classicism, homophobia,<br>
transphobia, and ableism? Students will gain conceptual clarity in discussing power and the nature of oppression.<br>
They will walk away from the class with a basic understanding of the history of feminism and of central concepts in<br>
feminist philosophy. Finally, students can learn to use philosophical analysis itself as part of a feminist toolkit.<br><br><strong>Course Designation/Attribute:</strong> VP,  DI<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> bi-annually<br><br></div>		</td>
