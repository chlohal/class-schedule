<div><h3>PHIL 213 - The Ideal of the Educated Person </h3>  <hr>This course explores the suggestion that in ideal circumstances there is a close relationship between being educated and living a happy or &#8220;good&#8221; life. Looking to Socrates and Plato for inspiration, we explore questions concerning the impact of acquiring knowledge on ethical behavior and moral character, as well as the impact of morality on happiness. Topics include: (1) the nature of knowledge, understanding, and wisdom; and the way in which formal education contributes to these states, (2) the nature of virtue and moral value, and (3) what it means to flourish in our culture.Â <br><br><strong>Course Designation/Attribute:</strong> VP<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> Offered periodically.<br><br></div>		</td>
