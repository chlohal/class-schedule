<div><h3>PSYC 020 - Topics in Men and Emotion </h3>  <hr>One of the most pervasive gender stereotypes in Western societies is the belief that men &#8220;aren&#8217;t emotional.&#8221; In this inquiry-based seminar we will look at available scientific theory and research to determine just how accurate this stereotype is. Do men actually experience and express emotions differently than women? Is this true for all emotions or just some more than others? How can an enhanced understanding of the gendered nature of men&#8217;s emotional experiences help us in promoting human well-being for both men and women? In addition to immersing ourselves in existing research, we will also carry out a new research study on masculine gender socialization and emotion. Students will be responsible for collecting, analyzing, and interpreting data focused on a research question that we will formulate early in the semester. First year students only.<br><br><strong>Course Designation/Attribute:</strong> VP<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> Offered periodically.<br><br></div>		</td>
