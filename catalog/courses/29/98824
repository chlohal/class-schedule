<div><h3>IDCE 348 - Dual Degree Capstone </h3>  <p><hr>The course is designed to have the DD students employ theory, lessons and skills taught by two departments (GSOM and IDCE) in a final project paper.Â The nexus of the IDCE and GSOM will be merged with both theory and practice, marrying business, environment and community. Students will chose from either a consultancy assignment for a specific client or preparation of a &#8216;business plan&#8217; for a entrepreneurial effort the student intends to undertake alone or in conjunction with others, as approved by the instructors and the students&#8217; advisor(s). The course will provide an important context and guidelines in completing the business plan or consultancy.</p>
