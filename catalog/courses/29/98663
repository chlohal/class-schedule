<div><h3>IDCE 30247 - Development Economics </h3>  <p><hr>Economics is crucial to understanding and practicing development. Although there are many schools of economic thought, this course will emphasize mainstream economics which serves as the foundation for development within a neoliberal context. This course has five objectives.</p>

<p>1. Become familiar with how economists create knowledge and their concepts, models, methodologies, and analytical processes, so that you can better understand how they formulate and shape development policies.</p>

<p>2. Understand the methods, data, and theories used by economists to study international economic development.</p>

<p>4. Gain practical experience in analyzing development problems using economic data</p>

<p>5. To critically examine and decolonize the knowledge produced by mainstream economists, thus exploring the root causes of current development in the knowledge systems that support them.</p>

<p>6. Learn about the process of economic development, the experiences of underdeveloped and developing countries, and possible explanations for the process of growth and the problem of underdevelopment.</p>

<p>7. Decolonize and explore alternatives to mainstream economics, such as degrowth, circular economies, and solidarity economies.<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> varied<br><br></p></div>		</td>
