<div><h3>PSYC 369 - Psychology of Inequality </h3>  <hr>Inequality is a persistent feature of human societies with profound consequences for intergroup relations, health and safety, and psychological processes. In this seminar, we will examine the psychology of inequality through critical examination of the psychological literature. We will discuss what inequality is, how power and inequality relate to each other, the origins of hierarchy in human and non-human animals, attitudes toward inequality, and the consequences of inequality for health, discrimination, and oppression. We will also examine social movements and other efforts to attenuate inequality. Our focus will be global and include examination of inequalities based on gender, age, social class, race/ethnicity, sexual orientation, and other intergroup relations.<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> Bi-annually<br><br></div>		</td>
