<div><h3>MUSC 014 - Introduction to World Music </h3>  <hr>This largely nontechnical survey course seeks to foster a meaningful understanding and appreciation of diverse musical experiences from around the globe. Our explorations will alternate between two distinctive approaches: (1) studying the musical cultures of specific geographical areas and (2) discussing broader topics of comparison between cultures. The ultimate aim is for each student to attain a more holistic, global perspective from which to savor each experience. Assignments will help students to listen more actively and also examine how their own basic assumption about music - what they take for granted - may comprise just one corner of a larger and richer &#8220;world&#8221; of musical possibility.<br><br><strong>Course Designation/Attribute:</strong> GP<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> Offered periodically<br><br></div>		</td>
