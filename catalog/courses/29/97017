<div><h3>ARTH 131 - Baroque Art in the Age of Bernini </h3>  <hr>Considers European art and architecture from around 1580 to 1680, the age known as the Baroque. An era of astonishing artistic activity, it was marked by lavish patronage by popes, cardinals and princes, centering on the cosmopolitan capital of Rome. This period was characterized by fundamental changes in society, a re-examining of religious imagery and orthodoxy, new and revolutionary scientific discoveries, a new global awareness and the growth of political absolutism. Explores how these developments informed the style, iconography and patronage of art. Analyzes works by some of the best-known &#8220;Old Masters,&#8221; including Bernini, Borromini, Caravaggio, Rubens, and Rembrandt. Topics include developments in optics and drama, the rise of landscape painting, still life and genre painting, as well as the concept of the Baroque unity of the arts.
