<div><h3>SOC 265 - Activism, Protest, and Social Movements </h3>  <hr>This course examines the dynamics of activist and protest movements, including the conditions that give rise to them, the factors that shape their development, and the ways they affect culture, society, and politics. We begin by exploring why and how protest movements come into being and why they sometimes win and sometimes do not. We then move on to questions about individuals in protest movements: why they join, why they commit, why they engage in high-risk behaviors, and how involvement changes them. Next, we examine what movements look like from the inside-how they craft narratives and rhetoric, how they stimulate emotional appeals to participants and to the powerholders they wish to convince, and how they cultivate leaders and form organizations to pursue their goals. We conclude with in-depth explorations of topics of current interest.<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> Offered periodically<br><br></div>		</td>
