<div><h3>CYES 200 - Special Topics </h3>  <p><hr>Content &amp; topics vary by semester and instructor</p>

<p><strong>SPRING 2023 TOPIC 01:</strong> <strong>EPISTEMIC INJUSTICE.</strong> This &#8220;special topics&#8221; seminar combines (i) an in-depth examination of the concept of epistemic injustice, and theories of social inequality as they relate to epistemic injustice, with (ii) fieldwork to explore the theory/practice conundrum.  It also supports exploration into praxis &#8211; what it takes to disrupt community-based and educational settings in the service of epistemic justice.  Participants will read a variety of philosophical and social science texts, link theories of epistemic injustice to fieldwork in school and after-school settings, all in the service of promoting more equitable educational outcomes.</p>

<p>The seminar focuses on epistemic (or knowledge-building) tools designed to disrupt epistemic injustice.  A key goal is deepening understanding of epistemic tools as levers of change in teaching/learning contexts.  Readings will interrogate theories of social inequality - at the macro and micro level - with emphasis on the micro: the complexities of teaching and learning in urban classrooms for social justice.  In addition to the seminar, the class will also involve 3 hours per week of fieldwork in a teaching/learning site (TBD, depending on the site selected).</p>

<p><strong>SPRING 2023 TOPIC 02:</strong> <strong>USING RACIAL EQUITY TO CREATE JUSTICE FOR YOUTH</strong>. Racial equity is a multifaceted concept that embraces the goal of eliminating inequitable life outcomes based on a person&#8217;s race. To achieve this goal, society must affect systemic change. In this course, we will explore how systems need a new emphasis on Positive Youth Development approaches that incorporate racial equity and inclusion. Furthermore, the course will investigate how Sociodemographic and racial discrimination have contributed to societal disparities. The course will include various forms of media and interactive resources to help to you actively engage with the material and guide you through your own self-awareness and reflection about these topics.</p>

<p>CYES 200 fulfills the CYES &#8220;Theories of Inequality&#8221; requirement or can be taken as an elective for the CYES major, minor, or Education minor. </p>
