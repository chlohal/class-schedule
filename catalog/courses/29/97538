<div><h3>GEOG 016 - Introduction to Economic Geography </h3>  <hr>This course is built on the assumption that we live in a world whose societies, cultures, governments, and environmental relationships are most significantly shaped by the mechanisms and influences of global capitalism. A fuller understanding of the dynamics of the world economy requires that we not isolate them from the political, cultural, social, and ecological contexts through and within which they are situated. Deeper contextual understandings are what economic geographers seek to achieve and this course surveys these perspectives with a focus on the locations and distributions of economic activities and the flows, interconnections, and drivers of uneven development in the global economy.<br><br><strong>Course Designation/Attribute:</strong> GP<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> Offered every year<br><br></div>		</td>
