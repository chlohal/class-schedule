<div><h3>GEOG 1791 - Local/Global Environmental Justice </h3>  <hr>This class will provide you with a stimulus and a forum for you to look at global and local environment and development issues through the eyes of people whose lives and livelihoods are at stake in the process of economic, ecological, cultural and political change in particular places throughout the world. The course will examine these changes through a fusion of environmental justice and political perspectives. Combing these two perspectives will help us look critically and creatively at the networks that connect us ecologically, politically and ethically with the people, living beings and places on the planet. They also help to illuminate the complex ways that race, class, gender, culture , and ethnicity intersect to shape the nature of environmental and development problems, including the ways in which people experience and become interested in these problems.<br><br><strong>Course Designation/Attribute:</strong> VP<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> 201905<br><br></div>		</td>
