<div><h3>IDCE 30287 - Fundamentals of Environmental Science </h3>  <p><hr>This foundation science class will give you the literacy and skills you need to understand the science behind environmental problems that affect us all: Water pollution; air pollution; environmental health risks; population growth and the over-exploitation of natural resources. It will also strengthen your math skills and quantitative ability. It has three main objectives. <em>Knowledge Objective</em>: That students be able to describe and understand how principles from science (especially Physics and Chemistry), as well as methods from Math, are used to model two main types of environmental problem: 1) problems of pollution; and 2) problems of natural resource over-exploitation. <em>Skills Objective</em>: That students be able to apply simple, yet powerful mathematical models to such problems, manipulating quantitative data and interpreting diagrams and tables that use these data. <em>Attitudes Objective</em>: That students become comfortable with handling quantitative data, equations and models, and more confident in their own abilities to understand and apply scientific and technical information.</p>
