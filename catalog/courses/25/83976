<div><h3>PSCI 232 - Chinese Politics </h3>  <p><hr>Is China rising, crumbling, or shifting? This course introduces students to the world of Chinese politics.Â  After a brief review of the Mao era, we will turn to the economic reform period (1980 - present) and its effects on contemporary issues such as the environment, political reform, democratization, social protest, and legal institutions. Each week we will discuss a different topic in China&#8217;s development and think critically about its implications for the regime and the Chinese people. Throughout the course we will build an understanding of Chinese history, leadership goals, and socio-political challenges. By the end of the course, students will be able to identify and compare key political issues in the country and critically evaluate China&#8217;s prospects for future political and economic reform. No prior knowledge of China or Chinese politics is required before taking this course.</p>
