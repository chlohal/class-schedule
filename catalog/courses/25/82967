<div><h3>GEOG 370 - Development&#8217;s Geographies: Debates and Interventions </h3>  <hr><p style="text-align:left;">James Ferguson once referred to development as anthropology&#8217;s &#8220;evil twin,&#8221; and geography also has had an at best ambivalent relationship with development. This course first explores the place of international development in the social sciences to then focus on its place within geography and anthropology. We consider how particular authors have engaged the notion of development, and focus our discussion as much on efforts at conceptual reformulation as critique. The course then considers to what extent it is useful to speak of development geography as an intellectual enterprise - again considering usefulness in terms of both theoretical and practical engagement. Through the notion of &#8220;geographies of intervention&#8221; the course explores the literatures on livelihoods, NGOs and social movement/organizations. For doctoral students only.<br>
