<div><h3>PHIL 104 - AIDS to Zika: Ethics and Epidemics </h3>  <hr>The global AIDS pandemic presents a public health challenge of unprecedented dimensions &#8211; a challenge which will test not only our scientific and medical establishments, but our commitment to social justice, professional fidelity, interpersonal solidarity and, especially, to the care of the world&#8217;s poorest and most disadvantaged populations. This seminar will draw on the rich philosophical, biological, epidemiological, legal, medical, and sociological literatures in order to examine a number of the moral and public policy issues which have been raised by the AIDS pandemic. Particular attention is given to the issues raised by the pandemic in developing countries.<br><br><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> VE placement or IDND 018<br><br><strong>Course Designation/Attribute:</strong> VE<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> Offered every other year<br><br></div>		</td>
