<div><h3>ENG 261 - Gender and Genre in the Nineteenth-Century British Novel </h3>  <hr>Using the nineteenth-century British novel&#8211;the predominant literary form in the mid-to-late nineteenth century&#8211;as a springboard, this course explores the intersection between gender and literary genres. Cultural expectations for male and female authors and the literary forms in which they wrote helped to define the literary history of nineteenth-century novels. This course will examine diverse generic models, from the domestic novel and the Bildungsroman to the Gothic and sensation novel, through authors such as Jane Austen, Charles Dickens, Charlotte Brontë and Wilkie Collins. Through a focus on nineteenth-century print culture, we will review the critical positioning and reception of these authors as well as their work. For undergraduate English majors, this course satisfies the Period (D-2) requirement.<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> Periodically<br><br></div>		</td>
