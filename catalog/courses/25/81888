<div><h3>HIST 175 - Holocaust: Agency and Action </h3>  <hr>This course is an introductory, gateway course to the history of the Holocaust. It aims to provide a foundation for more specialized seminars and lecture courses in this field (many of which are offered by the History Department), and is required for the concentration in Holocaust and genocide studies. The Holocaust was not a natural disaster, nor is history predetermined. Looking at a range of people, from national leaders to army generals to local religious figures to student activists, to victims, we will examine the choices they confronted and the actions they took. This course spans many centuries and covers the continent of Europe. Our primary focus, however, is the National Socialist era and the Holocaust.<br><br><strong>Course Designation/Attribute:</strong> VP<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> Offered every other year<br><br></div>		</td>
