<div><h3>EDUC 357 - Curriculum and Knowing: Math </h3>  <hr>One of the most important goals in any math classroom is to create confident problem solvers who are college-ready.  Have fun making math come alive with us as we explore, discuss, and write about the way we understand concepts found in the Common Core Practice and Content Standards that challenge the learners in our classrooms.  A large part of helping students make sense of mathematics is knowing where they&#8217;re coming from and where they are going, so we&#8217;ll work as a team both to experience and create interactive lessons across grade levels K-12 that both support and extend the thinking of ALL of our students.  Experiment with geometry, algebra, number sense, and more, and discover and create valuable manipulatives, resources, and activity ideas to take back to your own classrooms.  Prepare to experience &#8220;a-ha&#8221; moments of your own, which will rejuvenate your excitement about math! Participating teachers will prepare a unit plan to use with their students.  At a follow-up presentation in late fall, teachers will share their unit and student work.<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> Summer<br><br></div>		</td>
