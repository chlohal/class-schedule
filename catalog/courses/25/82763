<div><h3>SCRN 261 - Critical Perspectives on Television </h3>  <hr>This course explores fundamental questions about the cultural significance of television by considering a variety of theoretical and methodological approaches to television criticism, including ideological analysis, semiotics, political economy, feminist criticism, narrative, genre and critical race theories. In this course, we use these analytic tools to examine the cultural, political, and economic implications of television as a form of social communication. Our goals are (1) to become familiar with the key aspects of each theoretical perspective and (2) to apply these frameworks in our own analyses of television programs. By requiring students to continuously read, view, discuss, and write about critical perspectives on television, this course cultivates a deep understanding for the ideological and structural dynamics that constitute popular culture.<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> Offered periodically<br><br></div>		</td>
