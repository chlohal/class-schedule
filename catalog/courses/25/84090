<div><h3>GEOG 391 - Innovations in Earth Observations </h3>  <hr>Understanding the Earth System depends on observations of socioeconomic and environmental processes collected across multiple spatial and temporal scales, many of which cannot be addressed by existing Earth Observation (EO, or remote sensing) systems because of inherent tradeoffs between the extent, duration, frequency, and resolution of observation. In the past few years these obstacles have started to fall as new methods and technologies are introduced. This seminar will survey the key recent advances in EO, and their associated applications. A prerequisite for Geography and IDCE graduate students taking New Methods for Observing Our Changing World. Open to graduate students; advanced undergraduates may ask permission.<br><br><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> GEOG 383 Introduction to Remote Sensing must be completed before signing up for this course.<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> annually<br><br></div>		</td>
