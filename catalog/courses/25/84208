<div><h3>IDCE 30196 - Special Topics in Community and Global Health </h3>  <p><hr>This course is meant to engage in deeper conversations about different topics related to Community and Global Health (GCH). The course will be in a seminar format.</p>

<p>The topics covered range from methods, to theories, to applications from GCH emerging scholarship. May be repeatable for credit.</p>

<p><span class="highlight_1"><strong>FALL 2019 TOPIC: Community and Global Health</strong></span></p>

<p>This course will examine a number of key theories that have been used in health promotion globally (e.g., health belief, stages of change, PRECEDE-PROCEED and social-ecological models, among others). We will draw on real-world examples to explore the strengths and weaknesses of these various approaches. Additionally, students will be introduced to detailed case studies of specific health &#8220;interventions&#8221;, and will explore why some interventions succeed and others fail. Case studies will largely be drawn from the Global South and will focus, among others, on infectious disease control programs (e.g., TB, malaria), reproductive health (e.g., maternal health), sexual health (e.g., sexually transmitted infections) and child health (e.g., immunization campaigns). The course will discuss these issues from a multi-disciplinary lens that encompasses anthropological, feminist, global health and public health perspectives.<br><br><strong>Course Designation/Attribute:</strong> No<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> Annually<br><br></p></div>		</td>
