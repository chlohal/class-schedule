<div><h3>SCRN 130 - Film Genre </h3>  <p><hr>Devoted to the study of the major storytelling formats into which much narrative filmmaking (especially that of the American cinema) may be categorized. The course considers theoretical perspectives, formal description, historical background and social implications of genres such as the western, gangster film, musical, melodrama, etc., and through this work enables students to engage in and experience the interpretive insights of this critical perspective on the cinema. This course is taught as a variable topic, and may be offered as either an overview of several film genres or as a course concentrating on intensive study of a particular genre.</p>
