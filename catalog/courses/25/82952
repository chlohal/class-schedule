<div><h3>HIST 277 - America&#8217;s Founding Fathers: Memory and Meaning </h3>  <p><hr>Using the &#8220;Founding Fathers&#8221; paradigm as its focus, this pro-seminar in American political and cultural history explores the transmission of Revolutionary values and institutions across generations in the United States. Students will first explore the eighteenth-century world of the Founders before assessing how their legacies continue to influence present-day institutions and values. We will focus our attention in the latter part of the course on issues and controversies of urgent concern, including the Second Amendment and gun control, the Constitutional provisions for impeachment, and the complicated relationship among region, race, and American nationality.</p>
