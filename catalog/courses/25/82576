<p> </p>

<p><strong>SPRING 2020 TOPIC: US FOREIGN POLICY AND NATIONAL SECURITY</strong></p>

<p>This course examines U.S. foreign policy and national security, including the decision-making process, goals/objectives of policy, as well as contemporary and historical cases. Questions to consider: what leads to policy success? What factors lead to policy failures? What do historical cases tell us about the contemporary period? How do other states&#8217; responses to US foreign policy actions and behavior impact policy outcomes? What challenges does the United States face in the future?</p>

<p> </p>

<p><strong>FALL 2019 TOPIC: POPULAR CULTURE AND IR </strong></p>

<p>This course examines the connection between IR and popular culture through the examination of different modes, or tools, of popular culture and how these intersect with international relations theories as well as exploring popular culture to understand historical events in IR (World War I and II; Cold War, Post-Cold War, and the Post-9/11 and War on Terror). Recognizing the interdisciplinarity of the study of popular culture, we will read works by scholars in other disciplines, including film and media studies, history, and geography. Questions this course will consider include: How does popular culture relate to IR? How are IR concepts and topics represented and reproduced in popular culture? How can IR theories explain popular culture? How do different actors-both state and non-state actors-use popular culture for political goals?<br>
