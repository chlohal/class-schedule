<div><h3>ENT 105 - Creating a Culture of Innovation and Entrepreneurship </h3>  <hr><p style="text-align:justify;">This course explores the basic phases of innovation - identification, ideation and implementation.  Students will identify a problem, ideate solutions to the problem, and implement the solution, which will bring about change. Students will gain a greater understanding of, and appreciation for, innovation and entrepreneurship by the act of doing. Innovation concepts presented in this course are supportive of intrinsically motivated issues, the understanding of ones own constraints and resources, and the importance of self-awareness.  This course is typically taught as a first-year intensive for incoming students in the fall semester.  It is also approved for a Values Perspective (VP) in support of the program of liberal studies requirements.<br><br><strong>Course Designation/Attribute:</strong> VP<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> Fall Semester only<br><br></div>		</td>
