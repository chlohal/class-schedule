<div><h3>BCMB 276 - Chemical Biology - techniques and applications in research </h3>  <hr>An in-depth discussion of tools and techniques of chemical biology and its applications in research, with a focus on cancer research. After discussion of the chemical tools, we shall study current research utilizing these tools to address biological problems.Â  Some techniques that will be covered are chemical and biological library synthesis, library screening methods, quantitative techniques such as Fluorescence polarization, Surface Plasmon Resonance, Isothermal Calorimetry. Biological research problems such as kinase inhibition, modulation of protein protein interactions, targeted protein degradation in live cells and live cell imaging using biorthoganal reporters will be discussed.<br><br><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> BCMB271 and senior or instructor permission<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> Annually<br><br></div>		</td>
