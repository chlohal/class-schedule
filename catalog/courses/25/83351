<div><h3>MPA 3740 - Strategic Management for Public and Nonprofit Organizations </h3>  <hr>Strategic Management may be defined as an externally oriented philosophy of managing an organization that links strategic thinking and analysis to organizational action. This course examines the critical aspects of strategy and organizational planning and considers the key elements of strategic management - Organizational Analysis, Strategy Formulation, Strategy Implementation and Strategy Evaluation &amp; Control. The principles of strategic management are applied in a semester long examination of a social service, healthcare, arts and culture, government or other public or nonprofit setting. Strategic Management attempts to orchestrate a fit between an organizations external environment (political, technological, regulatory, social, etc.) and its internal situation ( values, culture, finances, marketing, human resources, IT, organizational structure and so on) and therefore offers the student a broad understanding of how the varied components of organizations work together to inform strategic direction and planning.<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> varied<br><br></div>		</td>
