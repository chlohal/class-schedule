<div><h3>SOC 012 - Introduction to Sociology in a Global World </h3>  <p><hr>Sociology is a discipline that studies the ways in which society shapes our lives, our relationships, and our identities. It traces the web of influence and connection that often escapes our notice because it falls beyond our immediate vision. In other words, much of what we experience (including such diverse activities as falling in love, getting a job, or committing a crime) can be shown to find its source and meaning in broader forces. Sociologists refer to these factors collectively as culture, social structure and history.</p>

<p><br>
In the past two decades, the scope and reach of these forces have broadened. We often refer to this trend as &#8220;globalization.&#8221; Time and space have compressed and the world has become increasingly interconnected and interdependent. This course is designed to broaden your analytic vision to examine the historical roots and contemporary manifestations of identity culture and community in a world transformed by globalization.</p>

Fulfills the Global Perspective requirement</p>
