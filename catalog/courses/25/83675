<div><h3>GEOG 286 - Special Topics </h3>  <hr>Devoted to a specific topic unique for each semester and instructor. May be repeatable for credit.; SPRING 2020  SEC. 1: GEOGRAPHIES OF POVERTY &amp; INEQUALITY - The gap between the rich and poor is growing, prompting concerns about what intensifying inequality and poverty might mean for society. This course will provide students with an opportunity to think deeply about the diverse causes, consequences and experiences of inequality and poverty. We will focus primarily on the United States, but we will look at historical and international comparisons as well, to help us identify and analyze the underlying structural causes and consequences of poverty and inequality so we might envision alternatives.;  SEC. 2: WRITER&#8217;S WORKSHOP SEMINAR - This course is designed for students who are seeking to advance and conclude a major piece of writing-whether a journal article, thesis or dissertation-during the semester. Using a workshop-style format, students will also have an opportunity to engage in the peer review process and will also be introduced to a variety of writing strategies, exercises and resources that will support the development of an academic writing habit. Students interested in the workshop must be prepared to write, revise and submit a major piece of writing by the end of the semester; a writing project with a clear scope and deadline are essential for success in this course. Open to graduate students and senior thesis writers in Geography.;  SEC. 3: GLOBAL AND LOCAL ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE WITH GIS - Integrates land systems science, political economy, and GIS to examine issues of environmental justice related to oil and gas extraction, processing, transportation and use, as well as alternative energy infrastructures. This course may be counted as a core course for either the Human-Environment OR the GIS area of study.;  SEC. 4: HOW THE CITY WORKS - Based around the production of a &#8220;citizens guide,&#8221; students will examine different parts of the city - its economy, its government, its financing, its cultures. Students will review and critically analyze existing academic knowledge about the city&#8217;s functioning parts. We will then reach out beyond academic debates, exploring how to understand and explain to others how the city we live in works.;   FALL 2019  SEC. 1 - LAND AND ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE: This course focuses on the geographical and interdisciplinary fields of land system science, vulnerability science and socio-ecological systems. Emphasis on student-driven research projects, empirical analyses, and integration with conceptual frameworks and methodologies in complex systems research, with applications to the science-policy interface.; SEC. 3 - URBAN FORESTRY - This special topics course will provide students in-depth experience with the interdisciplinary fields of arboriculture and urban greening. Relevant urban forestry literature will complement weekly field training in tree inventory and GIS mapping. Field inventory training and application will take place at a variety of sites in Worcester, but predominantly in the Clark University Hadwen Arboretum. Students can take advantage of arboriculture specialization certification opportunities while working alongside urban tree professionals affiliated with The Worcester Tree Initiative and the Massachusetts Department of Conservation and Recreation. A key goal of the course is to work with the City of Worcester to improve the condition of the Hadwen Arboretum. Fieldtrips for tree inventory locally every week up until late November. Interest in fieldwork is a key prerequisite. Database management and GIS analysis will also play a large role in this experience.<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> Fall and Spring<br><br></div>		</td>
