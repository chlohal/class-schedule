<div><h3>PSYC 319 - Advanced Topics in Social Psychology </h3>  <p><hr>An intensive treatment of key areas in social psychological research and theory, including consistency theories in attitude formation and in interpersonal perception; attribution theory in self-perception; and social/situational determinants of normal, everyday behavior and of antisocial behaviors such as violence, criminality and riots.</p>

<p><strong>SPRING 2020: </strong>Psychology of Prejudice and Discrimination&#8211;This course introduces students to psychological theories of prejudice and intergroup relations, with a strong emphasis on applying these theories to the multi-ethnic context of the United States as well as to other contexts in various part of the world such as Turkey, Germany, South Africa and Australia. The course will consist of mini-lectures, some large-group and small-group discussions, films, and opportunities to discuss ideas for research projects with peers. The course begins with an overview of key issues in the study of intergroup relations, in reference to perceptions and experiences of many native and immigrant groups in the United States as well as other groups around the world. We will then review classic and contemporary theory and research on prejudice and intergroup relations, with special attention to examples from social psychology. We will also focus on applications of such theory and research to pressing social issues, such as racial segregation in schools and affirmative action.<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> Offered periodically<br><br></p></div>		</td>
