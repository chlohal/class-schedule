<div><h3>SCRN 122 - History of American Broadcasting and Electronic Media </h3>  <hr>This course considers how broadcasting and electronic media have been developed over the past century. We will examine the technical achievements of the field as well as its social and aesthetic impacts from early electrical and wireless communication (telephone, radio) to mid-century inventions (television, satellites) and more recent innovations (cable, digital technology). We will sample a wide range of media productions, including early radio and TV shows, documentaries and current media phenomena. Students will do some of their own historical research on broadcasting to supplement the course material.<br><br><strong>Course Designation/Attribute:</strong> HP<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> Offered every other semester<br><br></div>		</td>
