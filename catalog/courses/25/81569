<div><h3>ENG 360 - Making Gender through the Eighteenth-Century Novel </h3>  <p><hr> </p>

<p>With an understanding that gender roles became more clearly defined in the eighteenth century, this course traces the formation of masculinity and femininity through the discourses of sexuality, sensibility, and sociability in eighteenth-century British literature. Through contemporary theory on the construction of subjectivity, gender, and sexuality, we will explore popular eighteenth-century literary forms-the romance, domestic, memoir and pornographic-to uncover the ways in which these texts helped to shape perceptions of men and women socially and culturally. <br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> Periodically<br><br></p></div>		</td>
