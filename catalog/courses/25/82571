<div><h3>PSCI 281 - Civil Wars in Comparative Perspective </h3>  <hr>This seminar will offer students the chance to explore the causes and consequences of civil war through a comparative approach by looking at evidence from civil wars around the world. We will also explore other issues related to the conduct of civil war, including violence against civilians, the use of child soldiers, and the problem of refugees. Finally, we will evaluate some of the competing arguments for and against negotiated settlement, partition, or other means of ending civil wars and moving toward post-conflict reconstruction.
