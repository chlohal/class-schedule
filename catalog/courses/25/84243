<div><h3>IDND 215 - Collaborative Learning: Facing the Uncertain Human Future </h3>  <p><hr>Collaboratives are an opportunity for students, faculty, and community partners to engage in genuine inquiry and a collective search for insight as they pursue a deeper understanding of the current and future challenges posed by a changing climate.  Collaboratives rely on horizontal learning and shared responsibility for the scope of questioning, an iterative learning process, and engaged praxis. Participants will begin their collaborative experience in an initial session of the <em>Council on the Uncertain Human Future</em>. From that common ground, members of a<em> Collaborative</em> will spend a semester moving through the following three questions:</p>

<ol start="1">
	<li><em>What is the issue, question, dilemma that we most want to grapple with? </em></li>
	<li><em>What do we need to know now?</em></li>
	<li><em>What do we choose to do, given what we know?</em></li>
</ol>

<p>For the duration of the collaborative experience, collaborative members will participate in a cycle in which they move from reflection and discernment to observation, application, action, and a return to reflection<strong><em>.</em></strong>  Collaboratives are intended to be dynamic, emergent, and iterative, therefore the direction of inquiry, the process of discernment, and the arena of action or intervention will be determined by collaborative members.  The collaborative experience is designed to build a learning community in which students, faculty, and community members practice establishing horizontal relationships of teaching and learning in which they grapple with an issue or problem of collective concern.<br><br><strong>Course Designation/Attribute:</strong> NA<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> 1 or 2 annually<br><br></p></div>		</td>
