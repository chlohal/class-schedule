<div><h3>PSYC 040 - Topics in Discourse </h3>  <p><hr>Through class exercises and small group work, students will learn fundamental principles, generalizations, and theories in a new area of knowledge pertaining to issues of language/discourse. The topics in discourse will vary each semester based on current and relevant issues. <strong>Fulfills the Language and Culture Perspective requirement (LP).</strong></p>

<p><u><strong>Fall 2017: Friendship</strong></u></p>

<p>How do we talk about ourselves and others as friends - and friendship in general? How do we tell friendship stories? Why don&#8217;t we &#8220;fall-in-friendship&#8221; as we &#8220;fall-in-love?&#8221; Are friendship-stories the same as love-stories - just without sex and the institutionalization in marriage? In this FYI we follow up on questions like this through the Language and Culture Perspective. It is expected that students will acquire the basic linguistic skills necessary for in-depth analysis of language, i.e., the analysis of language/talk. Students will be expected to commit themselves to a high-level academic atmosphere and a challenging workload that will result in stimulating class discussions. Must register for discussion section; participation in Weekend session is required.<br><br><strong>Course Designation/Attribute:</strong> LP<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> Fall<br><br></p></div>		</td>
