<div><h3>ID 131 - Local Action/Global Change: The Urban Context </h3>  <p><hr>In this seminar, undergraduate students at Clark, along with a selected number of activists and practitioners who are based in Worcester, elsewhere in the United States, or in the Global South will interrogate the &#8216;local&#8217;, the &#8216;global&#8217;, and explore the meanings and strategies to achieve social change and transformation.  Students will do so by reflecting critically on specific human rights, social justice and sustainable development issues or causes.</p>
<p>Through examining selected readings from the interdisciplinary field of development studies, and from political science, sociology, anthropology, international human rights law, gender studies, literature, art, and film; and through specific case studies, the students will learn about ways theorists, activists, civil society organizations, social movements and networks have conceptualized actions and strategies for change.</p>
<p>Students will supplement learning in class and from course readings, with practical community and global engagement with selected organizations and networks (especially youth networks and organizations) in Worcester, elsewhere in the United States, and globally.  Students will utilize the Internet (including email, Skype, Facebook and Twitter) for communication and action.<br>
