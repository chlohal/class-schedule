<div><h3>MGMT 100 - The Art and Science of Management </h3>  <hr>This course is designed to encourage students to consider how business is embedded into the larger society. It will introduce students to basic management skills and the context in which they are applied. Whether a person is working in a complex organization, such as a bank, university, high-tech firm, hospital or manufacturer; participating in a student-run activity; volunteering for a local nonprofit; or working a summer job-management skills are necessary. For management majors and minors, the course provides an introduction to the topics they will study in greater depth in their future course work. For students not majoring in management, it provides an opportunity to learn basic skills that will be helpful in their current and future activities in organizations. The course structure includes readings, lecture, service learning, case analyses, role plays and experiential exercises. The course involves considerable interaction between the professor and students, and among students, because the practice of management is about people working with, listening to, and respecting people who have different backgrounds, experiences and opinions. This class fulfills the Verbal Expression requirement.<br><br><strong>Course Designation/Attribute:</strong> VE<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> Offered every year<br><br></div>		</td>
