<div><h3>PSYC 371 - Creativity, Collaboration, and Human Development </h3>  <p><hr>This capstone seminar will focus on the relationship between &#8220;the new&#8221; (creativity) and &#8220;the good&#8221; (morality/ethics). How can we create, invent, and innovate in ways that builds from what already exists&#8211;but improves, enhances, or changes it for the better? How can we come up with good ideas and implement them to make a positive difference for ourselves and others? This capstone seminar explores what creativity is, how it develops and is implemented, its collaborative nature, and how it affects individual, societal and cultural development over time. We will examine theory and research as well as case studies to discuss the experiences, opportunities, contexts, and effects of creativity—especially for the greater good.</p>
