<div><h3>ENG 330 - Reading Voraciously: Food and Literature in the 20th Century </h3>  <hr>To claim that &#8220;cooking can produce something that approaches an aesthetic emotion,&#8221; was daring in 1954, when Alice Toklas situated herself among the modernists with the bold claim that cooking was a form of art. Yet she was also situating herself within a long literary and philosophical tradition of thinking aesthetic taste alongside gustatory taste. Taking up the idea of food as an aesthetic phenomenon, this course traces a transnational history of literary thinking about food within the long twentieth century, with special attention to the relationship between food and such identity categories as gender, sexuality, race, and ethnicity.<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> Bi-annually<br><br></div>		</td>
