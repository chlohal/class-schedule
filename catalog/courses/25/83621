</p><p><span style="font-size:10pt;font-family:'&amp;quot';color:#666666;">This First Year Intensive course will introduce students to the field of forest ecology, the process of scientific inquiry, and New England&#8217;s forest ecosystems. Understanding how ecosystems function and change in response to human activities and normal Earth system fluctuations is among the most important contemporary topics. Beyond having inherent scientific value, such knowledge has become integral to national and international policies and practices of ecosystem management. This intensive course will focus on forest ecosystems, which are one of the most important ecosystem types on Earth, and will consider fundamental ideas regarding how forests function, how they change, and how they are studied. As a First Year Intensive, this course will employ dialogical teaching, collaborative learning, and will also support students&#8217; transition to college and the development of foundational skills necessary to succeed.</span></p>
