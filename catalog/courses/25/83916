<div><h3>MGMT 5615 - Corporate Social Responsibility </h3>  <p><hr>The course explores different facets of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) and various perspectives in an objective manner enabling students to gain a broader and deeper understanding of the topic.  The approach taken is to build a foundation of knowledge of CSR, then discuss how CSR is applied in different arenas of the business, the workplace, the marketplace, the community and the ecological environment. Based on this, we examine the essential components of CSR management in terms of specific responsibilities, best practices and apply them in a real-world experience by helping a client. Social Responsibility topics include: Community Involvement &amp; Development; Environment; Human Rights; Fair Operating Practices; Labor Practices; and Consumer Issues.</p>

<p>Student teams are responsible for identifying and working with a client to develop and deliver a customized, actionable CSR Plan. Client organizations are to have at least 50 employees and may be a small business, non-profit or governmental agency.  Approval of the project, by the instructor, is required at least 60 days prior to the start of the course. Refer to the syllabus for an overview of the timeline for course preparation, the course structure and follow-on activity, as appropriate.  The project should align with the student&#8217;s area(s) of interest and be supportive of his/her career aspirations.<br>
