<div><h3>PSCI 295 - Globalization and Democracy - Capstone Seminar </h3>  <p><hr>How does globalization affect democracy? As economics, politics, military action and social-change movements have become increasingly transnational, have state leaders become less accountable to their populations, and are they under little pressure to build liberal democratic institutions? Or has the increasingly global system been good for democratic state-building? Have transnational forces successfully pressured states to observe human rights and fight against corruption? Do they encourage state leaders to build accountable economic and legal institutions? We will examine a variety of states and their struggles to consolidate liberal democracies, including: Sierra Leone, Cambodia and Russia.</p>
