<div><h3>MPA 3470 - Business and Society </h3>  <hr>The course will explore the relationship among the private, public and citizen sectors of society with a focus on the interplay between business and community. We will explore the relationship between business and society through the context of an implicit social contract where each has obligations and responsibilities to the other. It is the intent of this course to engage students in a rudimentary understanding of the interplay between business and society which may lead the student to examine his/her own attitudes and actions as a professional. In particular, to examine and articulate core challenges surrounding corporate social responsibility and organizational governance. The course will be conducted as an online/distance learning seminar and as such students must be self-directed and prepared to discuss weekly reading assignments and participate in analysis of case studies.<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> varied<br><br></div>		</td>
