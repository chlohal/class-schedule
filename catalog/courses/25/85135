<div><h3>HIST 250 - A Perfect Game: Baseball as History and Literature </h3>  <p><hr>Baseball has often been cited as &#8220;America&#8217;s game,&#8221; in that it is thoroughly interwoven into the history of American culture.  Baseball&#8217;s history reflects important themes and developments in American culture, including immigration and assimilation, race and civil rights, and globalization.  At the same time, baseball is a metaphor to which American writers return over and over to express their sense of American identity and culture.  This interdisciplinary course looks at &#8220;America&#8217;s game&#8221; from the perspectives of both history and literature and asks, what can baseball tell us about the United States and its people?  For undergraduate English majors this course satisfies the Period (D-3) post 1900 literature requirement.</p>
