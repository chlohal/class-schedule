<div><h3>ENG 205 - Culture and the News </h3>  <p><hr>Examines the social, cultural, political and economic factors that go into constructing what we call news in North America and specifically in the United States. This course also examines the &#8220;nature&#8221; of news media, their purpose, content and uses in late- 20th-century and early-21st-century America. Some of the major questions this course attempts to address include: How is news content determined and by whom and for what reasons? Who &#8220;owns&#8221; the news? How do news agencies and institutions &#8220;cover&#8221; local, national and international events and from what perspectives and why?</p>

<p>For English minors, this course counts as a 200-level English course.<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> Periodically<br><br></p></div>		</td>
