<div><h3>GEOG 246 - Geospatial Analysis with R </h3>  <hr>Free and open source R is increasingly used for geospatial analyses. R and its ecosystem of supporting software also facilitate the creation, presentation, and reproducibility of analyses. R is therefore very close to being a one-stop shop for the modern GIScientist. This course will provide students with the skills they need to use R as a GIS. There will be additional emphases on programming, presentation, and reproducibility, which will entail learning to develop R libraries, development of presentations and reports using Rmarkdown, and using version control with github. Students will learn and apply R skills by working on a specific research problem.Â  Open to upper level undergraduate and graduate students. Satisfies the <em>Skills requirement</em> o<em>r </em>can count as a<em> specialization course in GIS </em>in the undergraduate geography and global environmental studies major/minor.<br><br><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> GEOG 190 - Introduction to GIS<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> annually<br><br></div>		</td>
