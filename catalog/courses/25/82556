<div><h3>PSCI 260 - Democratic Theory </h3>  <p><hr>This course fulfills the political-theory requirement for the political science department. It traces the development of democratic theory from its origins in ancient Athens to the present day. We examine how diverse conceptualizations of democracy address key issues in democratic theory and practice, including the constitution of liberty, equality and political authority; the definition and actualization of citizenship; the proper relationship between the individual and the state; the proper balance between majority and minority rights; and the best means for citizens to participate in democratic government. We consider each of these key issues through our reading of influential works in the development of democratic theory and our active discussion of these works. This reading and discussion will enable us to broaden both our understanding of the democracy in which we live and our role as citizens within it. Formerly PSCI 156. Not open to students with credit for PSCI 156.</p>
