<div><h3>PSCI 218 - Punishment and Crime </h3>  <hr>This class examines theories that seek to justify criminal punishment and then analyzes those theories in a series of case studies.  We will explore retributive theory (punishment because it is &#8220;deserved&#8221;), utilitarian theory (punishment because of the consequences that it will produce), and expressive theory (punishment that expresses social values). Thereafter we will take up a number of specific case studies: homicide, conspiracy, attempt, the law of self-defense, hate crimes, and the death penalty.  Our goal throughout the course will be to consider the ways in which criminal law enforcement allows us to better understand our society and its values.<br><br><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> first year with permission only.<br>
