<div><h3>GEOG 321 - Ecologies of Resistance and Transformation: Alternatives to Development </h3>  <hr>This graduate seminar course explores the creation of alternative ecologies at the community and regional scale and their relation to global environmental change and economic and cultural globalization trends. The class examines works of social, ecological and cultural theories in light of several case studies including: Mondrogon in Spain; Chiapas and Oaxaca in Mexico: urban collectives in Denmark, Mexico and the U.S.; Science Shops for environmental design in India&#8217;s Naramada Valley and other sites: alternative farming in Amish and Mennonite communities in the US; permaculture farmers in Australia and the UK; Forest Peoples&#8217; communities in the Amazon and Mekong River Basins; international organizations such as Via Campesina; and the parallel efforts of Eco-Villages and Transition Towns. We will draw upon theories of Ecosystems, Networks, Complexity, Community, Autonomy, and the Commons, as well as theories of Justice, Identity, Difference and Solidarity. These theoretical readings will inform our understanding of cases studies and vice versa, as we seek to imagine Other Possible Worlds. We will use films, readings and discussions to critically engage with existing literature and examples and to create and question our own alternative visions of possible futures. Open to Geography doctoral students, Geography MS GIS and ICDE masters students and possibly undergraduates with special permission.<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> Offered every other year<br><br></div>		</td>
