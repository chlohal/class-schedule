<div><h3>IDCE 30111 - Urban Development: Process and Change </h3>  <p><hr>This graduate level course provides students with a framework for understanding the complexity of change in urban environments, including city building, shrinking cities, and regeneration. The course looks at current challenges and new strategies in cities experiencing job and population loss (&#8220;gateway&#8221; or &#8220;legacy&#8221; cities), as well as the situation facing cities that are rapidly expanding throughout the world.  The course will pursue several themes throughout:  1) the role of equity in urban development; 2) the challenge of resiliency in the face of changing external forces, and 3) the reality on the ground of real estate, governance, local culture, and politics that affect outcomes.  The course is open to Clark University graduate students and prospective ADP students in their senior year, who would take this as a graduate level course.  </p>
