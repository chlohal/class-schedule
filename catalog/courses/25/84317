<div><h3>ENG 272 - Radicalism and the Black Arts Movement </h3>  <p><hr>1966 to 1967</p>

<p>The Black Arts Movement remains the most radical realization of a literary culture in the history of the United States. Resulting from centuries of racial oppression, this movement is to be understood as black Americans&#8217; revolutionary use of art to express deep-seated existential rage and political critique in order to generate social change and psychological reconstruction. Accordingly, this course will examine the historical factors responsible for the emergence of the Black Arts Movement and will pay special attention to the thinkers and writers responsible for the articulation of its aesthetic manifestos and the production of its literary canon. For undergraduate English majors, this course satisfies the Period (D-3) requirement.<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> Periodically<br><br></p></div>		</td>
