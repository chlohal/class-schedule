<div><h3>IDND 087 - Challenge Convention, Change our World </h3>  <hr>The motto of Clark University is &#8220;Challenge Convention, Change our World.&#8221; But how does societal change happen? What theories and paradigms exist to help us understand when change occurs or fails to occur? This course will use a series of case studies to introduce students to the analysis of societal change. Among the cases we will study are Clark&#8217;s role in its Worcester neighborhood, social entrepreneurship in health care, contemporary social movements as a force for change, and efforts to improve educational opportunity in schools. Whatever your intended major, this course provides a foundation for your success at Clark. Students will have the opportunity to develop their own case studies, and will be presented with different ways of building capacity to lead and effect change. We will encourage social learning through dialogue and classroom discussions, lectures, multimedia presentations and guest speakers, capacity-building activities, and written assignments.<br><br><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> VE Placement<br><br><strong>Course Designation/Attribute:</strong> VE<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> unknown<br><br></div>		</td>
