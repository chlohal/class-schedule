<div><h3>GEOG 336 - Wildlife Conservation GIS Research Seminar </h3>  <hr>The course will follow a workshop-seminar and laboratory format in collaboration with research staff at Clark Labs and the Wildlife Conservation Society based in New York City. Students will work in small groups (i.e., no larger than three) for the semester on collaborative conservation projects in Rwanda, Guatemala,Â Cambodia, and other countries. Students will apply GIS and remote sensing skills to achieve explicit conservation goals related to land change assessment, hydrologic modeling, and ecosystem services valuation/modeling. Work will be performed in close collaboration with Wildlife Conservation Society research staff. Project results will be presented by student teams at the end of the semester to Wildlife Conservation Society staff. Open to doctoral and masters students.<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> varied<br><br></div>		</td>
