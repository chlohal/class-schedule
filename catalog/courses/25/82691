<div><h3>PSYC 315 - Social and Cultural Psychology of Genocides </h3>  <hr>This seminar reviews social psychological theories on the psychology of  genocide, addressing processes among victim, perpetrator, and bystander  groups. Perspectives from cultural psychology that allow for a more  contextualized understanding of the evolution of mass violence are also  included.Â While most of the available literature has dealt with the  Holocaust, we will also read and discuss the Armenian genocide; genocide  in Cambodia, Rwanda, and Sudan; and other relevant contexts and events.  In addition to discussing psychological processes and societal factors  that enable the evolution of genocide, we will address topics such as  rescuing behavior and resistance during genocide, propaganda and hate  speech, and psychological reactions to extreme mass violence. The  aftermath of genocide and questions of transnational justice will also  be briefly touched on.<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> Offered periodically<br><br></div>		</td>
