<p><strong>SPRING 2019 Topic: AMERICA CONFRONTS RADICAL ISLAM </strong>This course will explore America&#8217;s uneasy encounter with the Muslim world from the late 18th century to the present, with special emphasis on the Cold War and the post-Cold War era. Among the issues to be addressed are the rise of Arab nationalism, the ongoing Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and the emergence of Islamic radicalism. We will examine not only well publicized topics such as the Iranian Revolution and civil wars in Afghanistan but also lower profile matters such as the rise of Hamas and Hezbollah. Here is the overarching question that will preoccupy us this spring: &#8220;Is the clash between America and the Muslim world the product of fundamental ideological, strategic, and economic disagreements, or is it the result of cultural misunderstanding and mutual misperception?&#8221;<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> Offered every other year<br><br></p></div>		</td>
