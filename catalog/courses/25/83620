<div><h3>ENG 101 - Introduction to Creative Writing </h3>  <p><hr>This course will introduce the basics of creative writing, including poetry, creative prose, and the short story. We&#8217;ll start with poetry and shorter prose pieces, then move toward longer writing assignments. Beginning assignments will focus on the basics of creative writing, including word choice, invention, rhythm, and sound. Later assignments will explore characterization, voice, dialogue, setting, and conflict. This course will include weekly outside reading assignments, and you should plan to write frequently and copiously. Classes will be taught in seminar fashion and will include a combination of short lectures, writing exercises, class discussion, and workshops where you will discuss each other&#8217;s writing. By the end of the course you will have compiled a final portfolio of your own creative work. For undergraduate Creative Writing minors, this course counts as one of the introductory courses. </p>
