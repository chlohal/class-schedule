<div><h3>MSIT 3340 - Enterprise Resource Planning </h3>  <hr> An Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system is software that runs all business areas of an organization including accounting and finance, HR, sales and distribution, production, purchasing and inventory. ERP software integrates all these departments and functions onto a single system that can serve the needs of the entire company. ERP systems are very time consuming, costly and difficult to implement and institutionalize. Thus, an effective way to implement ERP is difficult yet extremely important to gain competitive advantage.This course is designed to provide the student with a thorough understanding of both the role that Enterprise Resource Planning Systems (ERPs) play in an organization and the challenging task of implementing and managing these systems. Literature has shown that over 50% of the implementation of ERP systems fail. Course content will include evolution of ERP systems, implementation cycles and well known cases on ERP implementation&#8221;<br>
