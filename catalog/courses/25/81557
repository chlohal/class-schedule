<div><h3>ENG 340 - Introduction to Graduate Study in English </h3>  <hr>Since many forms of literary theories proliferate, Prof. Levin strongly recommends that M.A. candidates take a course in literary theory to complement this course. Introduction to Graduate Studies will examine theories and methodologies pertinent to the study of literature by way of a focus on a special topic. For fall 2019, the special topic will be `Literary Studies in a Global Context&#8217;. What is the role of the humanities in the present moment? How does literature respond to pressing issues such as global inequality and climate change? How has literature imagined modes of globalization from the early modern to contemporary periods? M.A. candidates not specifically exempted are required to take this course.<br><br><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Seniors by permission only<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> Every fall semester<br><br></div>		</td>
