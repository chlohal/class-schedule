<div><h3>MPA 3111 - Cannabis Education and Enforcement </h3>  <hr>This course will examine how cannabis use can be viewed from both an educational framework as well as an enforcement framework.  For public policy officials, the emergence of the legalization of cannabis has perpetuated the myth that the drug is safe where in fact cannabis use has both medical and public safety issues.  (These issues ranges from cannabis induced schizophrenia to operating a vehicle while under the influence). This course views the various options that public officials can employ in implementing both educational and enforcement policies. <br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> Varied<br><br></div>		</td>
