<div><h3>EDUC 333 - Literature and Critical Consciousness </h3>  <p><hr>This course is designed primarily for full-time middle/secondary teachers.</p>

<p>With a specific focus on the genres of utopian and dystopian fiction, this class will explore speculative fiction as a form of social critique.  We will read novels and short stories written for both young adult and general audiences that use imagined future worlds to provoke questions about current social, political, technological and ecological trends. The course is designed for middle and secondary teachers, and will also address questions of critical pedagogy such as:  How can we transform our teaching to help awaken our students&#8217; sense of themselves as subjects of history and potential agents of change?  What role might the study of literature, and speculative fiction in particular, play in this process? How can literature help to forge bridges between students&#8217; school experiences and identities and the worlds they inhabit outside the classroom?<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> varied<br><br></p></div>		</td>
