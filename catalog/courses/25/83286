<div><h3>FILM 2320 - Literature on Page and Screen </h3>  <hr>The nature of literary creation and communication will be studied through our reading five novels and viewing the films made of them. Comparison of the book and film presentations will add dimension not only to our literary analysis of each novel, but also to our understanding of how we perceive meaning. Integral to our study is the nature of each medium&#8211;how, why and how well each works in our culture.<br><br><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Intermediate Composition.<br><br></div>		</td>
