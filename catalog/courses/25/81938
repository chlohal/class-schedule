<div><h3>HIST 260 - Rescue and Resistance During the Holocaust </h3>  <hr>Investigates rescue and resistance activities during the second World War. Our aim will be to come to a critical understanding of what we mean by &#8220;rescue&#8221; and &#8220;resistance,&#8221; and to analyze how these undertakings were organized, who participated in them and why people felt compelled to do so. Looks at the role and function (if any) of age, gender, degree of religious observance, political affiliation and social class in our attempts to understand not only what activities were undertaken, but the motivation for such actions.<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> Offered periodically<br><br></div>		</td>
