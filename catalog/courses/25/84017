<div><h3>MGMT 4050 - Foundations of Effective Management </h3>  <p><hr>The first of three required courses for the M.B.A. &amp; M.S.M. degrees, Foundations of Effective Management will provide management students with an introduction to critical thinking, creative problem-solving, practice-oriented research, and managerial communications. Each semester the Foundations course will address a complex global issue that has been identified by the UN&#8217;s Principles of Responsible Management Education (PRME). The upcoming semester&#8217;s topic will be business-based solutions to poverty. Students will work in teams to complete a Foundations Project Plan on this topic, applying foundational knowledge and the skills gained throughout the course. The teaching approach includes simulations, scenarios, case studies, writing assignments, and readings. Students will be exposed to techniques, materials, and mindsets used in management consulting, governments, think tanks, social enterprises, and businesses.</p>
