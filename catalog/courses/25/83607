<div><h3>IDND 022 - Writing: Horror, Serial Killers & the Grotesque </h3>  <p><hr><strong>Fall 2018 Topic: Writing: Horror, Serial Killers &amp; the Grotesque </strong></p>

<p>This course aims to understand the location of evil within text and visual media of the past and present: the evil of &#8220;the other&#8221; and the outsider, versus the evil within ourselves. We will research and discuss infamous names like Ted Bundy, Ed Kemper, Aileen Wuornos and Ed Gein as serial killers of American history. We will study the disturbing annals of Grimm&#8217;s fairy tales written far before Walt Disney got his hands on them. Students are encouraged to be creative, insightful and open-minded, especially in narrative voice and analysis within formal and informal assignments assigned throughout the semester.</p>

<p><strong>*Disclaimer</strong>: Some of the texts, television and films viewed as part of this class may be disturbing. They may contain forms of violence, harsh language, and horror in its many shapes and sizes in order to understand and analyze human monstrosity both in ancient and current history. If you are at all uncomfortable with the previously stated themes, this course may not be the right fit for you.<br><br><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Â </p>
