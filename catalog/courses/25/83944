<div><h3>MGMT 5616 - Sustainability Strategy </h3>  <hr>This course provides an introduction to sustainability strategy for organizations including corporations, non-profits and governmental agencies. Since the Paris Climate Accord of 2016, thousands of U.S. CEOs, mayors, governors, and university presidents have signed onto the &#8220;We Are Still In&#8221; pledge committing to take leadership on climate. In the last decade, the U.S. solar industry has seen over a 50% annual growth rate. Global Fortune 500 companies have set carbon-neutral goals. Sustainability is a constantly evolving and increasingly important aspect of business in the U.S. and globally. This course will explore topics such as current best practices for sustainability management, sustainability challenges facing organizations today, principles and tools that organizations use to measure and report on sustainability, marketing and reputation implications, and engaging stakeholders. The course combines lectures, case studies, and hands-on, real-world activities to allow students to investigate the intersection of business and non-profit with environment and practice building the business case for sustainability.<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> Varies<br><br></div>		</td>
