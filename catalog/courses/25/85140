<div><h3>PSYC 279 - Ethnicity, Race, Culture, and Child Development </h3>  <p><hr>In this course, we will examine both subjective and objective experiences related to ethnic, race, and culture among youth minority children across different contexts, such as familial, community, educational, and societal contexts. We will seek to understand the development of minority youth from an emic perspective, and will also explore how others in children&#8217;s environment (e.g., teachers, peers, observers) perceive them, integrating these different perspectives to evaluate how we can inform a culturally sensitive and empowerment-oriented environment for minority children and youths across different contexts. The aim of this course is to help students recognize the importance of considering these contextual factors to understand development, and if and how we can take these important factors into consideration in designing studies and programs of prevention and intervention so as to foster positive development for all children and youths.</p>
