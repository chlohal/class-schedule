<div><h3>BIOL 333 - Animal Locomotion </h3>  <hr>Students will explore the functional morphology of locomotion in animals (both invertebrate and vertebrate). The material that students will learn will integrate metabolism and physiology with morphology and ecology. Students will learn how components of the locomotor system work individually, and from the perspective of the organism. The underlying basic physics of how locomotion happens will also be considered. Students will present chapters from the textbook, discuss recently published research articles related to the textbook chapters, and write a term paper that will be a literature review on an aspect of locomotion that particularly fascinates each student. Students will learn to communicate effectively using written, oral, and visual presentation, and to think critically about material they learn about.<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> various<br><br></div>		</td>
