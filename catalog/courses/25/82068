The course will explore the phenomena of &#8216;education&#8217; and &#8216;international development&#8217; as they pertain to a range of intersecting and cross-cutting themes and social issues including HIV&amp;AIDS helath and education, gender and education, literacy/illiteracy and language, and displaced and migrant communities and educational access. The course will not only explore the themes and topics conceptually and theoretically - but will require students to engage with and conduct research within this conceptual &#8216;nexus&#8217; of global social topics/issues and formal and non-formal education - within the local Worcester community. The course is also intended to prepare and enable students to conduct &#8216;applied&#8217; capstone research.</p>
