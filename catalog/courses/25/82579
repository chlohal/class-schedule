<div><h3>PSCI 292 - U.S. Urban Policy - Capstone Seminar and Internship </h3>  <p><hr>This course is designed as a capstone primarily for advanced-level Political Science majors in the American Politics and Public Policy subfield and students pursuing the Urban Development and Social Change concentration. The readings and seminar sessions will explore the major factors and actors that influence city government policy-making, implementation, and outcomes. A broad range of topics will be considered, with special focus on economic development and redevelopment, neighborhood revitalization, and housing policies. In order to gain an understanding of the perspectives and actions of urban policy-makers and shapers students will also do an internship either with a Worcester city government elected official; the head of a city government agency or program; or the director of a neighborhood community development or housing non-profit organization. &#8220;Hands-on&#8221; learning through the internship will be shared periodically in seminar sessions. Limited to 12 students juniors and seniors. (Formerly GOVT 221).</p>
