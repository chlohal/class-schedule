<div><h3>PSCI 159 - Political Participation in the U.S. </h3>  <p><hr>In this class we will consider the different types of political activity in which American citizens engage, evidence regarding changes in Americans&#8217; political participation over time, and techniques that have been proposed to increase political participation. We will consider survey research on who participates in different types of activities, considering the role of, among other things, race, gender, education and income. We will then study different types of participation, including voting, interest group membership, jury service, and membership in religious and public-service organizations.</p>
