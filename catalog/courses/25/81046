<div><h3>ARTH 245 - Urban Art and Society in Jazz Age New York </h3>  <hr>In the 1920s and early 1930s, New York City was home to (or the inspiration of) some of the nation&#8217;s most innovative visual, literary and cinematic works. In this interdisciplinary seminar, we will investigate skyscraper architecture, paintings of city life, advertising photography, The Great Gatsby, art-deco furnishings, the Harlem Renaissance, and flapper movies. Through a mixture of secondary literature and a wide range of primary sources, we will explore broader themes such as the changing boundaries between &#8220;low&#8221; and &#8220;high&#8221; culture and the construction of an urban American identity as inflected through race, gender and class.<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> Offered periodically<br><br></div>		</td>
