<div><h3>IDCE 30120 - Analytics & Visualization for Development </h3>  <p><hr>This course introduces students to basic methods of analysis and visualization of quantitative data. We begin with an overview of big data in development, theoretical approaches to data analysis, explore some applications in the fields of health and development (among other topics). StudentsÂ will learn ways of locating, cleaning/wrangling, organizing, analyzing, visualizing, and presenting data from publicly available national and international databases.</p>

<p>This course will merely give students a taste of what data analysis is about, and how you can use it to make effective and well-thought-out decisions. We will not, unfortunately, dig too deeply into analytics, especially not machine learning or AI (although that would be tons of fun!). By the end of the module, students will be comfortable enough with the process of analyzing and visualizing data that they might want to pursue it further on their own.</p>

<p>While no prior statistical knowledge will be assumed, a familiarity with using Excel is essential for success in the course. For those who are not very familiar with Microsoft Excel, they will be required to complete an online (free) training course in the first two weeks of the course.</p>

<p>Success in the course will largely depend on students&#8217; curiosity , patience, and not being afraid to look at the world through a different and potentially unfamiliar analytic lens. Classroom sessions include lectures, discussions, and technical sessions. Course open to IDCE graduate students; ID seniors or ADP students with previous analytics experience. If space permits, graduate students from other departments may request permission to enroll in the class.</p>
