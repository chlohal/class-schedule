<div><h3>ENG 209 - Writing the Novel II </h3>  <hr><span style="color:rgb(35,35,35);font-family:palatino, serif;font-size:9pt;">For students who want or are in the midst of writing a novel. Much like Writing the Novel I, our workshop format will explore such elements of long fiction as scene, character, plot, setting, subplot, etc. We&#8217;ll address writing styles and techniques, giving and receiving criticism, revising, and genre. Students will complete a polished draft of the first 10,000 words of their novel or, having taken Writing the Novel, 10,000 polished words of their and the professor&#8217;s choice. Writing the Novel I is not a prerequisite for the course, but for those students continuing from WTNI, we will work on fine tuning such elements as secondary characters, humor, mid-novel blahs, stretching the writing muscles, and getting published. </span>For undergraduate Creative Writing minors, this course fulfills the advanced requirement.<br><br><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> ENG 101, 106, 107, 111, or permission of the Instructor.<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> Every year<br><br></div>		</td>
