<div><h3>HIST 307 - Exploring Public History through Old Sturbridge Village </h3>  <hr>This seminar will use Old Sturbridge Village as a case-study to discover the variety of ways history museums can engage and teach the public. Students will not only gain an understanding of the museum and the time period that it seeks to recreate, but a larger conception of public history, history museums, and methods for teaching the public. A major component of the course will be hands-on work with primary source documents and objects from the museum&#8217;s collection. Every class will be held at Old Sturbridge Village, which will allow us to utilize the museum and members of its staff to further our discussions of the topics covered each week.<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> Offered every year<br><br></div>		</td>
