<div><h3>GEOG 050 - Africa Today </h3>  <hr>Sub-Saharan Africa is arguably one of the most poorly understood, misrepresented, and oversimplified regions of the world.  This course will apply geographic theories and ideas to the study of Africa with the broad objective of building students&#8217; geographical literacy and their understanding of contemporary issues and circumstances influencing African peoples, communities, cultures, and environments.  Through in-depth discussions, debates, and analyses of case-studies detailing challenges and opportunities in the region, students will study Africa&#8217;s geography, explore Africans&#8217; everyday lives and their visions for its future, and critically examine the causes for and prospective solutions to economic, political, and social challenges facing the sub-continent today.  In doing so, students will confront mainstream stereotypes about African peoples, societies, politics, and economies and will encounter some of the interconnectivities and interdependencies between their lives and those of Africans. <br><br><strong>Course Designation/Attribute:</strong> GP<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> occasionally<br><br></div>		</td>
