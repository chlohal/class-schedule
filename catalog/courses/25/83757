<div><h3>MGMT 237 - Branding Concepts and Principles </h3>  <hr>This is an undergraduate management course whose purpose is to introduce the key concepts and principles of branding as a critical part of the new business landscape. These concepts will be delivered through cases, articles and global reviews of top brands in major product and service segments.  The delivery of content will rely on textbook studies of branding, along with articles from business magazines and other relevant sources.  Brand management is becoming more critical for both large and small organizations, as Corporate Social Responsibility and other issues become larger components of consumer and business buying decisions. The position of this course will reinforce the marketing principles taught in MGT 230 and will provide a good foundation for those students who seek an MBA and will take the more advanced Branding strategy course offered at the graduate level.<br><br><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> <a href="preview_course_nopop.php?catoid=25&coid=82292" onclick="acalogPopup('preview_course.php?catoid=25&coid=82292'+((location.search.match(/&print/i)) ?
