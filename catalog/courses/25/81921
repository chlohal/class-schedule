<div><h3>HIST 230 - The Topics in Armenian Genocide </h3>  <hr>The course will discuss some of the distinctive features of the Armenian Genocide and compare it with other genocides.Â  Some of the topics will be reviewed are the following: the origin of the Armenian &#8220;question&#8221;; Armenian reform attempts in 1894-96 and 1909 and its relation to genocide of 1915-7; Great Power policies during the Genocide - concentrating especially on German and American policies; question of humanitarian intervention and humanitarian relief efforts during Genocide; the experience of concentration camps during the Armenian genocide in comparison with other cases; Armenian Revolutionary Movements - their importance during the genocidal process; gender and the Armenian Genocide (especially the policies towards women and children and the question of orphans); resistance and the genocide; the legal process of economic plunder and confiscation of Armenian properties; the American response to Armenian Genocide in the post-genocidal period and finally the denial of genocide by successive Turkish governments and society and the question of Turkish-Armenian reconciliation are some of these topics that we will finish off the course with. Each case will be discussed in a comparative perspective. Throughout the course we also cover some of the current debates in the field such as the debate around &#8220;Captain Torossian&#8221; (an Armenian soldier in the Ottoman Army and his memoirs).<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> Offered periodically<br><br></div>		</td>
