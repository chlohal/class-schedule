<div><h3>ARTS 274 - Contemporary Directions </h3>  <p><hr>In this course we will discuss the subjects, issues and themes that are important to artists working today. What is the role, responsibility or purpose of contemporary art? Students will be expected to actively participate in discussions and complete all assigned readings and projects. This course will have two long-term projects in which each student is assigned a contemporary artist to research and create a body of work as a response to the assigned artist&#8217;s work. Including the following artists: Janine Antoni, Ai Weiwei, Josephine Halvorson, Jeff Koons, Kara Walker, Arlene Shechet and many more! Students will gain valuable knowledge of contemporary art issues, understanding how their work relates to other contemporary artists and practice presenting their own work.</p>
