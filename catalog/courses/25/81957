<div><h3>HIST 288 - Sem: Public History </h3>  <p><hr>The content of this Public History course can vary each time it is offered. <em>May be repeated for credit (taken a max of 2 times).</em></p>

<p>In Spring 2017 the topic will be Public History: Race, Photography and Community. This course is devoted to research and preparation for the photography exhibition, &#8220;William Bullard: Reimagining an American Community of Color, 1897-1917,&#8221; which will be open at the Worcester Art Museum in October 2017.  The exhibition will feature 80 photographs of people of color taken in Worcester.  In addition to gaining hands-on experience by preparing wall text for the exhibition and contributing to an accompanying website, students will learn about the larger contexts of African American history and people of color in Worcester at the turn of the twentieth century; about nineteenth century portraiture; the use of photography by black Americans for both personal and political purposes; and the many challenges of interpreting and presenting these images to the public.  Taught with Nancy Burns, Assistant Curator of Prints, Drawings, and Photographs at the Worcester Art Museum.<br><br><strong>Course Designation/Attribute:</strong> POP<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> Offered periodically<br><br></p></div>		</td>
