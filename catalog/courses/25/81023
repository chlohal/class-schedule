<div><h3>ARTH 109 - Greek Myth and the Classical Ideal in Art </h3>  <hr>Investigates selected Greek myths and the concept of the &#8220;Classical ideal&#8221; as expressed in art, both in ancient Greece and in various later periods, including the 20th century. Approaches the myths from the standpoint of origin and significance, changing modes of representation and manipulation for political purposes. The &#8220;Classical ideal&#8221; is also examined both as it originally developed and as it was conceived in subsequent ages. The course also considers the changing attitudes towards the classical world and the significance of the classical tradition in art and history.
