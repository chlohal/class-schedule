<div><h3>IDND 052 - Writing: Sense of Place </h3>  <p><hr>This is an introductory course to place studies that fulfills the verbal expression (VE) perspective. In part, the course will help you reflect on where you have been, ground you where you are, and illuminate where you want to go. We will accomplish this through readings, film studies, field expeditions, dialogues, place-based activities, mindfulness practices, and both formal and informal writings.</p>

<p>We will entertain guiding questions: What is a &#8220;sense of place&#8221; and why is it important? What characterizes Clark and the new city in which we find ourselves? What are the various lenses through which we can explore place? What forms a connection to place and the natural world? How does place shape identity, worldview, and imagination? How can we learn to see keenly and use our senses? How do our values and sense of self intersect with place and nature?<br><br><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> IDND 18 or Verbal Expression placement<br><br><strong>Course Designation/Attribute:</strong> VE<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> Varies<br><br></p></div>		</td>
