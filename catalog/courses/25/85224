<div><h3>PA 2941 - Internship-Organizational Behavior </h3>  <p><hr>When people come together in any setting, they develop both spoken and unspoken rules about how things should be done and how to prioritize tasks within the group. Understanding these patterns of interaction, and the relationship of the individual to the group, is essential to accomplishing your own goals in an internship, workplace, or with a group of people in any setting (including an apartment or program like Dynamy). This seminar explores the many factors that influence how groups of people work well together-or don&#8217;t!  Topics include the psychological contract, communication, group dynamics, conflict management, individual and organizational learning, conformity, and other related issues.</p>

<p>Readings and other media, personal stories, and the writing assignments provide a lens through which students broaden their understanding of themselves, organizations, and their particular internship placement. Conversely, internship experiences and class discussion provide a way to evaluate ideas and theories from the reading and discussion.  This interplay of theory and practice is central to the learning process of the Dynamy/Clark seminar.<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> fall 2019 will be last semster offered<br><br></p></div>		</td>
