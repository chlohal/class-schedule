<div><h3>ARTS 136 - Sculptural Dynamics </h3>  <p><hr>What is sculpture? These days, the term &#8220;sculpture&#8221; encompasses art ranging from traditional figuration to radical conceptual work, and everything in between. But there are some fundamental elements, common to all three-dimensional works of art that we can explore individually to gain a solid sculptural foundation. Scale, surface, structure, and materials - these are all fundamental properties of sculpture, and in this class students will begin to explore them. We will also examine the expressive implications of objects; sculptures are objects that communicate, and we will examine how they go about doing this.</p>

<p>The class will take a learning-by-doing approach, and as a result will emphasize process over product. The acts of making, looking, evaluating, and remaking are at the core of the sculptural process, and students will be encouraged to take risks and not be too precious with their pieces. We will use materials that are readily available, inexpensive, and that allow us to work quickly: cardboard, foamcore, found objects, etc. We will also look at examples of work, both historical and contemporary, to broaden our understanding of what sculpture is and what it can be. In-class assignments and take- home projects will emphasize sculptural fundamentals while allowing for broad interpretation.</p>
