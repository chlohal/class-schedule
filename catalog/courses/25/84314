<p><strong>Spring 2020 TOPIC: THE NEC COUNCIL COLLABORATIVE </strong></p>

<p>(half unit)</p>

<p>The NEC Council Collaborative introduces students to the theory and practice of council, deepens their engagement with the literature of climate change, and prepares them to help facilitate sessions of the Council on the Uncertain Human Future.</p>

<p>As a collaborative, the course is shared and horizontally organized. Conducted as a council and beginning with the CUHF process, its further structure and content are generated collectively, building especially on questions and problems generated by the students in the initial sessions.</p>

<p>Council practice is at the core of the New Earth Conversation, a curriculum initiative at Clark designed to explore the role of universities in the context of our unfolding climate disaster.</p>

<p>NEC asks, What are universities called to be and to do at this moment? How can we best prepare students to face the existential challenges of these times? The Council Collaborative goes to the heart of these concerns, while modeling one distinctive way of answering them.</p>

<p>Before enrolling in this course, students must have participated in one or more UHF Councils and receive permission of the instructors.</p>

<p><strong>Spring 2020 TOPIC: section 03 LOCAL CLIMATE JUSTICE PRAXIS</strong></p>

<p><strong>Fall 2019 TOPIC: </strong> <strong><span style="font-family:'bookman old style', serif;font-size:11pt;">CLIMATE PRAXIS: REFLECTION AND ACTION FOR THE UNTHINKABLE</span></strong></p>

<p>This Collaborative will explore the question of how we live responsibly in the unprecedented time of climate crisis. We will explore the question of why we have collectively failed to appropriately address the threat of climate change for the past 40 years as well as looking forward to how we navigate coming disruption. After engaging in the Council on the Uncertain Human Future process, students will co-design the remainder of the course with an emphasis on holistic approaches.<span style="font-family:'bookman old style', serif;font-size:11pt;"> </span><br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> every semester<br><br></p></div>		</td>
