<div><h3>PSCI 180 - International Organizations </h3>  <hr>International Organizations (IOs) have grown in size, number, and institutional capacity since the end of the Second World War to address various policy matters in the area of economics, trade, taxation, finance, intellectual property rights, environment, human rights, international security, and humanitarian intervention. The increasing complexity of the global political economy has made policy coordination and harmonization through international organizations absolutely necessary because of the absence of a centralized governing authority at the international level. As the demand for IOs have increased, they have also become more controversial and divisive with supporters seeking to strengthen them, while detractors are attempting to modulate their influence. This course will explore the complex roles international organizations play in navigating international politics and mediating transnational policy issues by concentrating on a select set of international organizations that are central to the day-to-day functioning of the global political economy.<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> Offered periodically<br><br></div>		</td>
