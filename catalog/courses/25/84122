<div><h3>MIS 5650 - Applied Business Analytics </h3>  <p><hr>The goal of this course is to cultivate students&#8217; capability to apply data analytics and decision support modeling to industry decision problems characterized by complex market and regulatory environments and competing demands for resources. Students will learn a framework for quantitative decision making and effective resource allocation under uncertainty that is applied today in many business analytics and decision making contexts. The course will focus on (1) identification and collection of relevant data for analysis; (2) identification and application of the appropriate models and techniques (e.g., capital budgeting, cost benefit analysis, optimization, and Monte-Carlo simulation); and (3) structuring the decision problem in terms of strategic alignment, feasibility, cost effectiveness, and risk. By the end of the semester, students will understand how to assess the business context and apply business analytics skills to the managerial decision problem; structure and implement a complex decision analysis; select appropriate data and analytical methods and build spreadsheet models; apply project management principles and tools to the completion of complex analysis; and present and defend an analysis and recommended investment program.<br>
