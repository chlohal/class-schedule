<div><h3>GEOG 351 - Seminar in Critical Resource/Food Geographies </h3>  <hr>This course examines major questions in two important areas of critical geography: natural resources and food studies. Each topic will take one-half of the semester. We will first examine questions of nature and culture, and the role of the state and biopolitics, which are of concern for scholars of both topics. We will then turn to political economic theory on commodity chains or value chains, and power relations along those chains. We will address questions such as the &#8220;resource curse&#8221; and ethical consumption. Questions of sovereignty, territoriality, and investment relations will also be examined, as well as, questions of state and quasi-state governance. The resource component will emphasize water, minerals and oil/gas. Open to doctoral and masters students.<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> Offered every other year<br><br></div>		</td>
