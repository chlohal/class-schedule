<div><h3>HS 012 - Mindful Choices </h3>  <p><hr>What holds my attention, and calls for me to explore it further? What do I enjoy, and what do I care most about? Where do I find a sense of meaning and purpose?</p>

<p>How do my interests and concerns relate to the choices I am making in my education? Do I listen well to what my intuition is telling me about my life choices? How do I visualize myself participating in our society and world when I graduate?</p>

<p>Students are invited to explore and reflect on these questions in a new art-making course called Mindful Choices. This guided, intensive arts immersion will offer students a chance to engage in creative practice and reflection as they consider paths of study at this important juncture of their undergraduate career, and encourage a more conscious commitment to the direction of their education. The process of exploration and discernment will be supported through artistic practice in the visual arts, music or creative writing.</p>

<p>Students will receive a half-credit for the course, which is pass/fail.<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> Fall and Spring<br><br></p></div>		</td>
