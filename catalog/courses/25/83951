<div><h3>GEOG 101 - Food Justice and Food Movements </h3>  <hr>In this course we will be examining the meaning of &#8220;food justice&#8221; and the multiple movements attempting to change the highly destructive existing industrial food system in the US and elsewhere.  At the same time, we will be working on the Real Food Challenge at Clark. The Real Food Challenge is a US student-led campaign to shift institutional purchasing toward food that is more humane, worker friendly, environmental sound, and advancing of local economies.  In signing the Challenge Clark University committed to having 20% &#8220;real food&#8221; by 2020. &#8220;Real food&#8221; consists of food that has certain certifications to qualify it as local, fair, humane, or ecologically sound. This class will incorporate the practical work that goes along with the commitment, working on the real food calculator and raising campus awareness of the Challenge, with learning the intricate world of the global productive system. This means looking through the lens of the Real Food Wheel to examine all of the different facets that make the food system. This means producers, earth, consumers, customers, and earth. The Real Food Wheel will act as the vehicle for explaining the social, cultural, ecological, moral, and economic impacts of the modern food system.<br><br><strong>Course Designation/Attribute:</strong> VP<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> Annually<br><br></div>		</td>
