<div><h3>PSYC 1560 - Cultural Psychology </h3>  <hr>Provides a survey of theory, methods and research in culture and psychology. We will discuss different definitions of culture, and consider what the different definitions imply for how culture should be studied. Cross-cultural psychology and cultural psychology provide two general frameworks for addressing the complex question of how culture informs human action and experience. We will examine these approaches and explore the role of culture across a range of areas, including perceptual and cognitive processes, human development, identity and emotion. Issues concerning cultural contact and intercultural relations will be considered, and we will explore cultural phenomena such as the cultural organization of the environment, tourism and pilgrimage, burial processes, and music.<br><br></div>		</td>
