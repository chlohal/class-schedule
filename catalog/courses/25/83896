<div><h3>EDUC 254 - Education in Film: Media Representations of Race, Class, Gender & Schooling </h3>  <p><hr>Education in Film employs two disciplinary frameworks-sociology of education and critical media studies-to analyze film as both a product and producer of American society and culture.  Students in the course systematically examine Hollywood representations of teaching and schooling, particularly examining the social construction of prevalent narratives about teachers, urban youth, suburban youth and schooling. Through critical engagement with Hollywood films about education, students learn to identify dominant educational ideologies, and conduct media analysis based on race, class, gender, and sexuality. <strong>Course meets as a three-hour seminar with an additional required film screening time.</strong></p>
