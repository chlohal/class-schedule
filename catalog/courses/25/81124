<div><h3>BIOL 102 - Introduction to Biology II </h3>  <hr>The goals of this two-semester course are: (1) to provide an understanding of the unifying themes in modern biology, (2) to introduce the diversity of life at all levels of organization, and (3) to illustrate the methods and modes of scientific inquiry currently used in the biological sciences. During the fall semester (BIOL 101) the focus is on fundamental principles of evolution and genetics, whereas in the spring (BIOL 102) the diversity of life, from cells to organisms, is explored. The two courses do not have to be taken in sequence but both are pre-requisites for all advanced courses in biology. Students will be charged a lab fee upon registering for this course.<br><br><strong>Course Designation/Attribute:</strong> SP<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> Offered in sequence every year<br><br></div>		</td>
