<div><h3>IDCE 30109 - Introduction to Epidemiology and Biostastistics </h3>  <p><hr>In contrast to clinical medicine, which traditionally has focused on health in <em>individuals</em>, epidemiology investigates the distribution and determinants of health at the <em>population </em>level. Social epidemiology tries to understand how social and economic factors influence population health and contribute to disparities in health. Biostatistics provides the analytical tools needed to understand and critically evaluate, interpret, and communicate findings from epidemiological research. This course will cover basic principles of epidemiology and biostatistics and the use of epidemiological methods to study the associations between exposures and the risk of disease. We will also investigate how social and economic factors influence exposures, particularly among susceptible populations-and how epidemiologists and biostatisticians study and communicate these interactions.</p>
