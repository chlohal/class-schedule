<div><h3>BIOL 362 - Stream and Riparian Ecosystems </h3>  <hr>The course, Stream and Riparian Ecosystems, will explore these critically imperiled ecosystems in a holistic manner, considering how these linked ecosystems are structured by geological, geophysical, and fluvial factors, chemical factors, and biological communities.  Because stream ecosystems are embedded within a larger matrix of upland ecosystems, the course will also consider the effects of these on streams.  The course will required students to read and synthesize a wide diversity of papers from the scientific literature. A research or position paper, depending upon the student&#8217;s interest, will be required. The course will be divided into three sections of variable length, covering a) the natural structure and functioning of stream/riparian ecosystems; b) the effects of alterations of both the stream and riparian ecosystems themselves, and also alterations of the uplands within which the streams are embedded; and c) the problems and issues in restoration. Socio-economic, political, legal, and ethical considerations will be interwoven within the entire course.<br><br><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Permission<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> Spring Annually<br><br></div>		</td>
