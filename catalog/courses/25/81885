<div><h3>HIST 165 - Nazi Germany and the Holocaust </h3>  <hr>Introduces students to the rise, the fabric, and the fall of the &#8220;Third Reich.&#8221; It starts with an investigation in how the Nazis came into power and why the first German democracy failed. The course then focuses on two related issues. Both are revolving around the success and the impact of Nazi politics in Germany and in Europe: How could Hitler and the Nazi Party establish its power in a country which was seen as a heart of Western culture? And: Why did so few Germans oppose Hitler and his racially based, terrorist regime?<br><br><strong>Course Designation/Attribute:</strong> HP<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> Offered periodically<br><br></div>		</td>
