<div><h3>EN 217 - Place-Based Ecological Knowledge </h3>  <hr>The complex challenges of the 21<sup>st</sup> century require transdisciplinary collaborations that integrate different ways of knowing our environment. This course explores the diverse knowledge systems of Indigenous peoples and others who live in close relation to land, such as smallholder farmers, herders, hunters, fishers, and gatherers.Â  We begin by examining theories of ecological knowledge developed by anthropologists, human ecologists, and ethnobiologists, including the work of Indigenous scholars. Next, we demonstrate research methods used to engage place-based ecological knowledge, focusing on participatory research in which communities are involved in research design, data collection, interpretation and validation. In the last part of the course, we will consider how place-based and scientific ecological knowledge can work together to address ecological challenges, including wildlife management, food production, and adaptation to climate change. Graduate students taking the course will work in teams to conduct research in local communities, develop a short publication to be shared with community partners, and present their findings to the class.<br><br><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Juniors &amp; Seniors Only<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> Annually- Spring<br><br></div>		</td>
