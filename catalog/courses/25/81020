<div><h3>ARTH 010 - From the Stone Age to Our Age: Monuments and Masterpieces of Western Art </h3>  <p><hr>Begins with a reach back in time to the dawn of history 20,000 years ago when the earliest creators in the western world painted powerful images of animals on walls located in the eerie, dank depths of cave interiors. This startling act marked the beginning of communication through visual images. We will move chronologically through history, exploring the major monuments and masterpieces of painting, sculpture and architecture, and the cultures that produced them. By focusing primarily, although not exclusively, on select key monuments-the Pyramids, the Parthenon, the Pantheon-and on the masterpieces of major artists-Raphael, Rembrandt, Renoir, Rothko (among others)-from prehistoric times to our own computer age, we will gain an understanding of visual culture and of the needs and aspirations that are expressed.</p>
