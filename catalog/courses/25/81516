<div><h3>ENG 206 - Writing the Novel I </h3>  <p><hr><span style="font-family:palatino, serif;font-size:9pt;">For<strong> </strong>students who are trying to write book-length fiction, or who want to discover if they have the temperament and talent for it. Our aims within our workshop format are to get you writing, to keep you going, and to help you improve. All successful novels contain common, essential elements, which we will isolate. In addition to the usual suspects - character, theme, setting, plot-we will also examine elements such as suspense, story question, voice, point of view, scene, sequel, genre and others. We will also talk a bit about avenues to publication; types of publication (paper, Web, eBook, audio); acquiring an agent; and marketing your work. Students will complete a polished draft of the first 10,000 words of their novel. For Creative Writing Minors, this course counts as one of the advanced courses.</span></p>
