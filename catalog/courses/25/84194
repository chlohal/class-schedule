<div><h3>HIST 069 - Introduction to Medieval History (400-1400) </h3>  <hr>This course provides an introduction to the history, civilization, and culture of Western Europe during the Middle Ages (ca. 400-1400), from the &#8220;fall&#8221; of Rome to the beginning of the Renaissance. By broadly exploring political, social, cultural, and economic developments of this period, we will try to answer the question of what is medieval history and ultimately determine what makes this period unique. Special attention will be devoted to the importance of the Church in shaping &#8220;the contested norms&#8221; of medieval life, the evolution of new forms of political power, the foundations of new systems of knowledge, and the workings of social and gender hierarchies. The course will focus mainly on Western Europe, but will also consider key developments in the neighboring civilizations of Byzantium and Islam, as well as the influences these civilizations brought to bare on the medieval west. We will also consider modern appropriations of medieval history, from Hollywood to White Power movements. The course will introduce students to basic skills employed by historians including how to analyze primary sources, how to identify and critique scholarly arguments, and how to develop written arguments<br><br><strong>Course Designation/Attribute:</strong> HP<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> Bi-Annually<br><br></div>		</td>
