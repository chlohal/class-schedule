<div><h3>ENG 256 - Ecologies in Crisis: View from the Humanities </h3>  <p><hr>New Earth Conversation Collaborative</p>

<p>This collaborative asks participants to explore the idea of `ecology&#8217; in cross-cultural perspective, with particular consideration to literary responses to climate change in different cultural and political contexts.  We will think comparatively about the representation of ecological crises, and about likenesses and differences in literary portrayals of environmental thought-including relationships between human and non-human species and objects. The course will explore the cultural and philosophical frameworks that govern dominant modes of extraction and commodification, regimes of energy and power, understandings of waste and disposability, and models for food production and consumption.  `Ecologies in Crisis&#8217; will be offered as a pilot `collaborative&#8217; for Clark&#8217;s program in <em>New Earth Conversations</em>. For undergraduate English majors this course satisfies either the Period (D-3) or the Theory (E) requirement, but does not double count.<br><br><strong>Course Designation/Attribute:</strong> POP<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> Periodically<br><br></p></div>		</td>
