<div><h3>SOC 271 - Family Diversity </h3>  <hr><span style="font-size:12pt;">The family is considered to be one of the most private and pervasive social institutions in society.   All of us have had contact with at least one family and many of us will be involved in several different families during our lifetime.  Families today are more diverse, they include a complex array of household arrangements, and they are more easily fractured.  Throughout the course we will look at how social structures shape and restructure the family.  The course will provide an overview of the various family forms giving emphasis to working class families, gay and lesbian families, families of different racial/ethnic backgrounds, singlehood and cohabiting families in the United States.  We will also explore research and public policy questions about families from a sociological perspective. </span><br><br><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> SOC 200 - Class, Status and Power and SOC 175 - Sociology of Family or by permission<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> Annually<br><br></div>		</td>
