<div><h3>ENG 120 - Introduction to Shakespeare </h3>  <hr>The purpose of this course is to (re-)introduce you to the rich, complex, and potentially radical politics of Shakespearean expression. To that end, we will thoroughly examine seven of Shakespeare&#8217;s plays (along with a range of film interpretations) and attend specifically to how they explore the many ethically resonant issues-injustice, political corruption, gender, sexuality, class, race, etc.-that continue to challenge our world. By engaging in this process, it is my hope that we will begin or continue our development as sophisticated interpreters of the past and the present and, in turn, ethically oriented shapers of the future. For undergraduate English majors this course satisfies the Period (D-1) requirement.<br><br><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> VEÂ Prerequisite<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> Periodically<br><br></div>		</td>
