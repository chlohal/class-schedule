<div><h3>PSYC 395 - Social Science Research to Influence Public Policy </h3>  <hr>The purpose of this course is to teach students strategies for using  their research knowledge to influence public policy decisions,  particularly at the state level. Students will also be involved in the  planning and implementation of the Family Impact Seminar, a seminar  where Clark faculty and their colleagues present research to state  legislators at an annual symposium at the State House in Boston in late  March. Students will learn the importance of using research to influence  public policy, the challenges in translating research into a format  that is relevant to policymakers, and strategies for overcoming those  challenges.<br><br></div>		</td>
