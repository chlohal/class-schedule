<div><h3>IDND 011 - Making a Difference </h3>  <hr>This course will offer a scholarly perspective on &#8220;making a difference,&#8221; defined as the many varieties of social change ranging from philanthropy to political activism. Students will analyze how others have made a difference in a range of times and places, and will learn skills to make a difference at three levels: in their lives, on the Clark campus, and in the city of Worcester. This is a multi-disciplinary course in which readings will be derived from the fields of sociology, psychology, community development, urban studies, education, social policy, and political science. Themes of personal growth, leadership, collaboration, and activism will be explored. In addition to writing assignments, students will be expected to participate actively in class discussions and experiential exercises, as well as complete a structured service placement in a neighborhood agency. The concluding assignment will be a proposal for community-based social change activity.<br><br><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> VE placement required<br><br><strong>Course Designation/Attribute:</strong> VE<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> unknown<br><br></div>		</td>
