<div><h3>IDCE 30240 - Community Development Planning Studio </h3>  <p><hr><span style="font-family:calibri, sans-serif;font-size:10pt;">The community planning studio is an applied, results-driven exercise typically required in planning (and architecture) graduate programs. The objective of the exercise is to place students in direct contact with a real-life planning scenario in an urban setting, working with real organizations and community stakeholders. The topic of the studio changes every year. Students tackle one common problem working in teams to address distinct dimensions of the task at hand. In previous years, students assessed the capacity of community-based organizations in Holyoke (MA) to pursue federal funding from the Dept. of Education, and provided support to a network of community-based organizations and Clark University to plan for the development of the Main South Promise Neighborhood Partnership, Worcester (MA). Depending on the nature of the project, students used a variety of research and local planning methods: surveys; strategic use of data; interviews; multi-media; economic analysis; needs assessments. </span></p>
