<div><h3>EDUC 353 - Curriculum & Knowing in Art </h3>  <p><hr>This Institute is designed for those who wish to explore possibilities for powerful teaching in the visual arts.  During this Institute, high school, middle school, and elementary art teachers, as well as interested classroom teachers, will share a variety of teaching techniques, processes and methods.  Participants will engage in artistic studios with recycled and non-recycled materials for prototype creation and critique.  Culminating activities will support participants in developing ready-to-use lessons for their own classrooms.</p>
