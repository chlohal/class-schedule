<div><h3>BIOL 101 - Introduction to Biology I </h3>  <hr>The goals of the two-semester biology introductory sequence are: (1) to provide an understanding of the unifying themes in modern biology, (2) to introduce the diversity of life at all levels of organization, and (3) to illustrate the methods and modes of scientific inquiry currently used in the biological sciences. During the fall semester (BIOL 101) the focus is on fundamental principles of evolution and genetics, whereas in the spring (BIOL 102) the diversity of life, from cells to organisms, is explored. The fall and spring courses do not have to be taken in sequence but both are pre-requisites for all advanced courses in biology. The labs accompanying BIOL 101 provide practice in biological investigative techniques, critical thinking, and scientific communication through a series of lab exercises directly related to lecture content.  The FYI labs follow a different curriculum, providing a research experience spanning the semester and directly investigating the rising need for the development of new antibiotics.  <br><br><strong>Corequisites:</strong> Must register for lab for BIOL 101.<br><br><strong>Course Designation/Attribute:</strong> SP<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> Offered every year.<br><br></div>		</td>
