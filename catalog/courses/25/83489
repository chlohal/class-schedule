<div><h3>MSIT 3410 - IT Strategy Leadership </h3>  <hr>IT Strategy requires a business-driven enterprise IT governance framework and use of day-to-day best practices. Leaders must ensure that IT investments respond to the most important business issues and opportunities. The scope of project efforts needs to cover business and IT people (internal and external), business process improvements and IT factors in a balanced solution. The velocity of change in most industries today requires companies to periodically defer continuous improvement efforts in favor of those that genuinely transform the firm dramatically and rapidly to another state. Such changes are almost always highly leveraged by technology. It takes strong leadership and discipline to make it happen? leadership from the executive team and board, from the CIO and senior IT staff, from key functional managers across the company who get it and insist on it. The course goal is that you gain understanding of the factors involved and you start to define what all this means to you and your career.<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> varied<br><br></div>		</td>
