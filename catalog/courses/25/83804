<div><h3>SOC 2630 - Deviant Behavior </h3>  <hr>What is deviance and how is it &#8220;constructed&#8221; within society? While some experts on deviance take a decidedly objective approach to deviance-the idea that all cultures recognize certain behaviors as deviant and unacceptable, this course will focus on the ways in which deviance is socially constructed-the idea that behaviors are deemed &#8220;deviant&#8221; based on societal definitions and are therefore not static but subject to change. Viewing deviance through a subjective (rather than objective) lens requires that we pay close attention to the dialogue that takes place between individuals and society over time, as it is this dialogue that will help us to determine what is and what is not acceptable within society. This course uses cultural, social, political, and even religious cues as clues to uncover deviance within society in all of its forms and functions.<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> varies<br><br></div>		</td>
