<div><h3>ARTS 128 - Drawing: Sense of Place </h3>  <hr>Students will engage the environment of Worcester by drawing on site at a variety of locations, from abandoned factories to Victorian parks, a littered railbed to a wooded Quaker cemetery. By actively looking, we will forge a connection to this city, while recognizing other relationships to placeâ€”-including the archetypal places we carry or inhabit within ourselves. The emphasis will be on learning how to see where we are and to be more fully aware of how this relationship to place defines us. Globalization, Internet intimacy, easy mobility and politics may all influence our understanding and feelings about place, but there is perhaps nothing so immediate and illuminating as the act of simply perceiving and translating the world around us. Artists who have referenced or manipulated &#8220;place&#8221; in their work will also be studied. <br><br><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> ARTS 102 or ARTS 129<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> Offered periodically/fall semester<br><br></div>		</td>
