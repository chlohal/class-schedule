<div><h3>PSYC 391 - The Psychology of Mindfulness </h3>  <hr>This capstone seminar will examine the intersection between contemplative practice such as mindfulness meditation and recent empirical research in cognitive neuroscience, affective science, and clinical psychology. Emphasis will be placed on the history and origins of mindfulness practices, the scientific study of the practices, and adaptations of mindfulness practices by Western scientists for the treatment of psychological disorders and enhancement of well-being.  <br>
<br>
Key questions this course will address include: 1) What is contemplative practice and how does mindfulness influence psychological well-being? 2) What are the historical origins of mindfulness practices and how have such practices been adapted by Western scientists? 3) How does Western empirical inquiry inform our understanding of mindfulness (i.e. mechanisms)?<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> Offered periodically<br><br></div>		</td>
