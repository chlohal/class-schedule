<div><h3>EDUC 3900 - How to Teach College Students </h3>  <hr>This one-unit course is designed to familiarize participants with the basic principles and educational theories of teaching at the college level.  By the end of the course, a participant should be conversant in areas such as the design and development of an effective syllabus; planning a cohesive series of course modules with actionable learning outcomes; the use of technology as a pedagogical stratagem; and be able to design an effective strategy to evaluate students&#8217; learning and acquired competencies.  Course activities include readings, lectures, discussions, individual and group projects. Course content will cover pedagogical approaches, general classroom management (including student conduct, grading policies) and the complexity of the intercultural and intergenerational classroom. A segment of the course will focus on the management of difficult conversations. The course is designed for individuals who will teach at the college-level (including community college) for the first time.<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> Fall or Spring<br><br></div>		</td>
