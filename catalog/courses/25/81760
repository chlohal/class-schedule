<div><h3>GEOG 357 - Internet Geography: Socioeconomic Impacts of Information Technologies </h3>  <p><hr><strong>Spring 2018 Course Description:</strong><br>
In the span of a few decades, the Internet has become a driver of global change and has connected people and places to an unprecedented degree. However, to what extent does the Internet transform or supersede the structures, configurations, and arrangements that make up our world? How does the Internet interact with, and produce, geographies at various scales? In light of the rapidly changing environment influenced by the information revolution and the Internet itself, the answers to these questions are not universal, or even immediately apparent. Therefore, it is necessary to develop an explanatory framework that places the Internet into a broader historical, social and political-economic context. By adopting a geographical perspective, this course prepares students to challenge abstract notions of the Internet as a placeless informational cloud, by analyzing its grounded causes, consequences, and impacts at various scales. This course will cover a range of topics related to the history, technology, politics, regulation, and practices of the Internet and associated communication technologies. The course is centered on weekly readings and group discussions.</p>
