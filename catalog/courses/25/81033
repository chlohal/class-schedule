<div><h3>ARTH 143 - Art from 1940 to 1970: Modernism and Its Discontents </h3>  <hr>A survey of the major trends in art between 1940 and 1970, focused primarily, but not exclusively, on the art scene in Europe and the United States. We will begin with the emergence of New York as the center of the international avant-garde and the seat of Abstract Expressionism in the years after World War II. The course will then trace the disintegrating confidence of the mid-20th-century modernist moment, examining such movements as neodadaism, pop art, minimalism, and the land artists of the late 1960s.<br><br><strong>Course Designation/Attribute:</strong> AP<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> Offered every other year<br><br></div>		</td>
