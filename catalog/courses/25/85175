<div><h3>PSCI 005 - Memories of Europe: From Total War to Integration </h3>  <p><hr>Victor Hugo described history as &#8216;an echo of the past in the future.&#8217; This course will provide students with an opportunity to listen to, and consider the sources of, these echoes from Europe&#8217;s sometimes bloody, sometimes brilliant 20th century - while also thinking about their continuing relevance today, for both Europe and the U.S. Using the unparalleled access offered by our location in Luxembourg, together we will consider the political and cultural legacy of major (and familiar) historical events, political developments, and social forces such as World War I, the Great Depression, nationalism and fascism, World War II, the Holocaust, and the evolution of European integration by journeying to the spaces in which they occurred, and continue to be remembered.Â  In doing so, we will pay particular attention to the ways in which public and private narratives, memories, symbols, memorials, and commemorations have shaped construction(s) of &#8216;Europe&#8217; both past and present. The course will feature field trips to locations throughout the region including sites in Luxembourg, France, and Belgium. This is an introductory-level course and requires no prerequisites.</p>
