<div><h3>PSYC 373 - Children with Disorders </h3>  <p><hr> This course is designed to provide upper level students the opportunity to delve deeply into the topic of child &amp; adolescent psychopathology. In particular, students in the course will become familiar with: 1) the conditions and disorders that typically develop and/or are diagnosed during infancy, childhood, and adolescence, including their diagnostic criteria, course and chronicity, and prevalence in the population, 2) how such disorders represent deviations from a more typical developmental trajectory, 3) the etiological or causal factors attributed to each disorder (i.e., genetic &amp; environmental), and 4) current intervention and prevention practices. The course will also emphasize a developmental perspective and take an empirical approach.<br>
<br>
At the conclusion of the course, each student should be able to:<br>
<br>
1)       Describe the relative contributions of genetic, family, school/community, societal/cultural factors to the development of the primary childhood and adolescent disorders<br>
<br>
2)       Identify symptoms and diagnostic criteria for each disorder/condition<br>
<br>
3)       Explain current approaches to treatment and/or prevention of childhood psychological disorders<br>
<br>
4)       Evaluate the merits of an empirical article as well as the value of clinical research translated for public consumption</p>
