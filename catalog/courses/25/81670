In this class, we will explore and learn about Worcester using a variety of lenses: field trips, historical accounts and documents, contemporary statistical data, and scholarly analyses of broader US urban trends. We will visit cultural institutions such as the Art Museum, document social life via photography of streets and parks, and learn about the city from local experts. At the end of the course, you will be able to describe and critically assess Worcester in terms of US urban development, institutional and neighborhood resources, and your own experiences of its many landscapes.
