<div><h3>PSCI 280 - Politics of Food and Drink </h3>  <p><hr>How are policies surrounding food production, nutrition, and alcohol consumption developed in the United States? Who influences these decisions and in what ways?  For instance, what is the connection between poverty and obesity, and how should the government respond to these challenges?  How can we understand the recent rise in interest for local, organic, and fair trade food, and should policies actively promote these choices?  How does freedom of speech influence debates over food advertising and labeling? The course will explore these and other ethical and political questions related to food and drink in the U.S. We will examine the development of state and national policies as well as key rulings by state and federal courts. While the focus is primarily on domestic politics, throughout the semester we will also discuss comparative examples from across the globe, examining the wide range of factors that influence agriculture, food and drink, and nutrition policies, programs, and choices.  We will also consider the role of international organizations and international trade agreements.</p>
