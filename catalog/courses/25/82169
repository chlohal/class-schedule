<div><h3>IDCE 30221 - Education and Development </h3>  <p><hr>This is an introductory graduate course in &#8216;international education&#8217; that explores the nexus of Education and International Development.  Education (formal, non-formal and informal) has played a significant role in shaping societies - and has conversely been shaped by societies.  The course critically examines intersects of education and international development efforts and initiatives - at the community, national and international levels. This course examines the historical evolution of formal education and explores its continued and complex (local and global) relationship to the processes of national and international development and globalization.  It explores the roles of global institutions and the emergent policies that influence how states conceptualize, plan and implement education, and it explores the range of institutions and organizations and stakeholders that engage with and in the development and delivery of &#8216;education&#8217;.</p>
