<div><h3>MUSC 226 - Music Theater Collaboration </h3>  <p><hr>Music Theater Collaboration is designed to give students a collaborative and interdisciplinary experience in musical theater. The course investigates the genres and sub-genres of 20th and 21st Century musical theater through hands on projects that will encourage performance, critical analysis and artistic risk taking. Students will learn important terms, people and roles associated with the creation of musical theatre and practical vocabulary for talking about musical theatre. Students will be expected to present collaborative projects based on specific musicals. These projects can take many forms but the focus will be on strategies for focused collaboration, creation, research, implementation, performance, and presentation.</p>
