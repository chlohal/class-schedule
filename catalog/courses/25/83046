<p>SPRING 2020 TOPIC: TRADING MODELS FOR SPECULATIVE MARKETS - Speculation is distinct from investing, and the tools and models we employ to identify and exploit trading opportunities are very different from the valuation-based models used for investing and risk management.  This seminar focuses on trading rules and algorithms that have been successfully employed by speculators.  We primarily study commodity and financial derivatives markets, including technical analysis, spread trading, market psychology, and algorithmic trading.  The course involves lectures/discussion as well as extensive use of the GSOM Bloomberg room for hands-on experience.  The course emphasizes experiential learning and can be used to satisfy this requirement for MSF students.  Prerequisite is Investment Strategies FIN5203.<br><br><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Prerequisites vary depending on the course.<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> Varies<br><br></p></div>		</td>
