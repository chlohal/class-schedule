<div><h3>ID 121 - Culture, Health, and Development: What Makes Us Sick? </h3>  <hr>Why are there so many different approaches to health and healing worldwide? How are the experiences of illness and suffering fundamental to human lives and societies? What are the major health challenges of the 21st century and how will we resolve them? This course introduces students to the intersection of medical anthropology with international development and global health. The course explores theoretical and methodological approaches in medical anthropology and how anthropological tools can be used to study health and disease. We will explore how different societies cope with illnesses from epilepsy to HIV/AIDS and how medical anthropology offers a unique way of addressing health problems in domestic and international settings.<br><br><strong>Course Designation/Attribute:</strong> GP & DI<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> varied<br><br></div>		</td>
