<p>Spring 2019 Topic: Technology in Ancient Art.</p>

<p>Have you ever asked yourself about great works of ancient art and architecture, &#8220;How did they DO that?&#8221; How did the Egyptians build the pyramids?  How did the Greeks construct the Parthenon (in only nine years)? What are the secrets behind building of the Roman Colosseum? Did Nero really have a rotating dining room? Did you know that Renaissance painters actually didn&#8217;t invent perspective in painting? Spoiler: the Greeks did. This seminar will explore select examples of ancient architecture, sculpture, and painting-looking at the ancients&#8217; mastery of technology and engineering in the production of the monuments we so admire today. The overarching theme of the course will be the close relationship between materials and techniques of art and their expressive content-their meaning and lasting significance. </p>
