<div><h3>TA 206 - The Image and the Word </h3>  <p><hr>This is a 200 level studio class for advanced and intermediate playwrights and photographers. Through lectures, performances, and demonstrations, students will discover how photographers illustrate through images while also learning the way writers are influenced by what is visual. Students from these two different mediums will collaborate with one another in creating their respective works. The final project will be a gallery exhibit of concluding photographs and text shared with the Clark community.</p>

<p>Students will be charged a V &amp; PA lab fee upon registering for this course.<br><br><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> ARTS 120 or TA 230 <br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> Offered periodically<br><br></p></div>		</td>
