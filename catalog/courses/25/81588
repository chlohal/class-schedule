<div><h3>ENT 245 - Social Entrepreneurship </h3>  <hr>&#8216;Social Entrepreneurship&#8217; explores the relationship between the social issues confronting our global community and the use of business creation to stimulate ( &#8220;creatively disrupt&#8221;) local and world change. This course challenges the student to look beyond well-established business objectives - the creation of wealth - and investigate how wealth creation can impact public good. A review of global social entrepreneurial initiatives is an important focus of the course. Students consider such diverse social issues as environmental degradation, poverty, homelessness, lack of potable water, world health and education concerns, microcredit and more.<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> Offered every semester<br><br></div>		</td>
