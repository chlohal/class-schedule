<div><h3>GEOG 116 - Forest Ecology </h3>  <hr>Understanding how ecosystems function and how they change in response to human activities and normal Earth system fluctuations are important themes in contemporary natural sciences. Beyond having inherent scientific value, such knowledge has become integral to national and international policies and practices of ecosystem management. This course provides a foundation in forest ecology by considering the function, structure, and composition of forest ecosystems. Topics include forest succession, long-term ecological variability, disturbance ecology, ecological resilience, and the influence of climate and environmental heterogeneity on forest patterns and dynamics.<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> Offered every year<br><br></div>		</td>
