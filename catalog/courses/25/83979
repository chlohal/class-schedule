<div><h3>HIST 289 - Dying for God: Martyrdom in Early Judaism & Christianity </h3>  <hr>This course examines the beginnings of martyrdom in the ancient Mediterranean, the cradle of Judaism and Christianity.  Looking closely at the historical context - the intellectual, social and political developments - that gave rise to the iconic figure of the martyr in the world of late antiquity, we will explore how men and women came to embrace the opportunity of &#8220;dying for God,&#8221; and why the cult of martyrdom became a public institution.  Ancient people viewed the spectacle of martyrdom with an equal measure of admiration and alarm; looking closely at evidence of their ambivalence, we will gain some perspective on our own mixed feelings about this deeply disconcerting phenomenon/<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> Bi-annually<br><br></div>		</td>
