<p><span style="color:#000000;font-size:8pt;">Much of the research done by sociologists involves quantitative analysis. This course focuses on the design and execution of quantitative studies. While we do learn to use/interpret some complex statistics (e.g., correlation and regression analysis), this is not a statistics course. PRIOR KNOWLEDGE OF STATISTICS IS NOT REQUIRED. Our primary focus will be on research design, that is, how to properly construct a study. In the process, we will </span><span style="font-size:8pt;">develop an <u>intuitive</u> understanding of the sorts of data analyses conducted by sociologists. This will enable us to read, interpret, and understand the tables and graphs produced by sociologists.<span style="color:#000000;"> These skills will enable us to engage the core of the course: the use of two data sets, each of which has yielded multiple publications. Initially, we review a number of published studies with an eye to learning how to best design a quantitative study. Subsequently, we will design original research projects using each data set. Finally, we will conduct the research and analyze our findings.</span></span><br><br><strong>Course Designation/Attribute:</strong> FA<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> Periodically<br><br></p></div>		</td>
