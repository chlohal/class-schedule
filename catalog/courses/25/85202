<div><h3>EDUC 271 - Critical Issues in Education </h3>  <hr>This course is designed to have students confront, discuss, and understand the issues that are currently affecting American public schools.  These are the critical factors at the macro-level of public education: those issues that determine the goals, strategies, and contexts in which public school teachers work.  Students will explore the dilemmas of these critical educational policy issues with an attention to how the educational policies maintain or challenges social inequities in schools.  Students will come to understand not only each of these areas but the relationships among them-the intersections of these factors.<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> Fall or Spring<br><br></div>		</td>
