<div><h3>PSYC 241 - The Psychology of Resistance during Genocide </h3>  <p><hr>What enables people to resist against violence and oppression, even when they are targeted and severely restricted such as during genocide? How do people overcome the uncertainty and fear that characterize these situations, and what motivates them to engage in resistance even when this can mean sure death? This seminar explores these questions about the psychology of resistance among victim groups during genocide and mass violence, drawing on oral histories and academic literature. This course is interdisciplinary, and addresses students of Psychology, Sociology, Holocaust and Genocide Studies, Peace Studies, IDCE, Race and Ethnic Relations, and other social sciences. Students in this course will (1) develop lay theories of the psychology of resistance; (2) work with video-recorded, archived oral history interviews that were conducted with genocide survivors during the Holocaust and other genocides; (3) integrate this knowledge with psychological and sociological literature on this topic; and (4) apply this knowledge to other contexts. Students will present their individual and group work in class and at Academic Spree Day. </p>
