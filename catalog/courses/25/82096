<div><h3>IDCE 310 - Intro to Geographic Information Systems </h3>  <hr>Intro to Geographic Information Systems / Lecture, Laboratory This graduate-level course introduces Geographic Information Systems (GIS) as a powerful mapping and analytical tool. Topics include GIS data structure, map projections, and fundamental GIS techniques for spatial analysis. Laboratory exercises concentrate on applying concepts presented in lectures and incorporate two widely used GIS software packages - IDRISI (created by Clarklabs) and ArcGIS (created by ESRI). These exercises include examples of GIS applications in environmental modeling, socio-demographic change and site suitability analyses. Although the course is computer-intensive, no programming background is required. This course counts as skills course for IDCE graduate students.<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> Offered every semester<br><br></div>		</td>
