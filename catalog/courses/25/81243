<div><h3>CHEM 333 - Synthetic Organic Chemistry </h3>  <hr>There is a huge variety of organic molecules that are interesting and exciting, yet need  to be made through organic synthesis before they can be studied.  This course focuses on the synthesis of organic compounds including the scope and limitations of general methods, mechanistic aspects, and stereochemistry.  Special emphasis is placed on the total synthesis of complex molecules including design and execution of the syntheses as well as the importance of the targets. The course material will draw from text books as well as primary research articles, and a substantial amount of class participation will be expected.<br><br><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Graduate students must have a strong background in organic chemistry (equivalent to at least a B- in Organic Chemistry II)<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> Offered every other year<br><br></div>		</td>
