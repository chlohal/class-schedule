<div><h3>TA 236 - Playwriting II </h3>  <hr>This is a course for advanced playwrights who want to bring their work to a higher level. As a result, much is expected in terms of productivity and quality. Students will write a minimum of 10 new pages per week, in addition to rewrites that are suggested in and out of class. New pages will be read and critiqued in class each week. There will be an open discussion of the strengths and weaknesses of the piece from the perspectives of both performer and writer. The goal is to strengthen this relationship through constant work and critique. Every month, students will give a public performance of some of the scenes written for class. By semester&#8217;s end, each student will have completed one full-length play and a complete act of another full length.<br><br><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Playwriting I is a prerequisite. Permission is also required.<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> Offered periodically<br><br></div>		</td>
