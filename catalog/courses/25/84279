<div><h3>GEOG 186 - Special Topics: </h3>  <p><hr>Devoted to a specific topic unique for each semester and instructor.Â  <strong>FALL 2018 TOPIC: GEOGRAPHIES OF POVERTY &amp; INEQUALITY</strong></p>

<p>The gap between the rich and poor is growing, prompting concerns about what intensifying inequality and poverty might mean for society. This course will provide students with an opportunity to think deeply about the diverse causes, consequences and experiences of inequality and poverty. We will focus primarily on the United States, but we will also look at historical and global examples for context. Throughout the semester, we will move through a series of inquiries to explore how housing, food, transportation, health, the environment, and work and wages are related to course themes. We will use academic articles, maps, videos, short stories, reputable news sources, policy briefs, art and in-class discussion to help us identify and analyze the underlying structural causes and consequences of poverty and inequality so we might envision alternatives.</p>
