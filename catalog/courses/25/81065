<div><h3>ARTS 133 - Painting II </h3>  <p><hr><strong>Beyond the Surface/Rotating Faculty:</strong></p>

<p>Emphasis on representational painting, but we will also strive to see beyond the appearance of things. This course will continue an exploration of painting techniques including more experimental media and approaches to the depiction of form and space on a two-dimensional surface. The game of illusion in trompe l&#8217;oeil will challenge the student as will the metaphysics of apprehending the physical world. Can the invisible be made visible?</p>

<p><strong>States of Being/Rotating Faculty:</strong></p>

<p>After a basic introduction to painting, one can experience more elaborate and personal directions within the medium. This course will look at alternative notions of space and states of being such as micro/macro, dream and psychological states, as well as cyberspace. Painting II again taught from varying perspectives based on the studio work of each professor.</p>
