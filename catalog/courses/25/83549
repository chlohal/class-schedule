<div><h3>ID 229 - Property and Community </h3>  <hr><span style="font-family:verdana;font-size:8.5pt;">&#8220;Property is not a thing, but a social relationship,&#8221; is this course&#8217;s point of departure. Questions relevant to a &#8220;social relations theory of property&#8221; have captured attention within the social sciences on many fronts. For example, what are the rights &#8216;ownership&#8217; in different societies? What gives property its value (prestige, power, privilege)?  How do land tenure and property rights interventions change community relations, family dynamics, and/or improve environmental outcomes? Course readings are global in nature, allowing us to examine property as a social relation in South Asia, Africa, and Latin America. Students are involved in setting some of our collective learning objectives and learning outcomes / assessment tools.  UG Capstone eligible seminar; Fulfills IDCE Conservation and Development &amp; Gender and Identity concentration. </span><br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> varies<br><br></div>		</td>
