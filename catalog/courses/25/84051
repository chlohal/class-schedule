<div><h3>Biol 312 - Microbiomes </h3>  <hr>The course will explore current research on microbiomes found in a variety of habitats: Â human and plant associated, marine, and soil. Through a mixture of lectures and discussions, students will learn about core ecological concepts relevant to microbiomes and microbiology. Throughout the course, students will read primary scientific literature and gain practical skills in how to understand and interpret research articles. Students will learn about current sequencing and molecular techniques (including 16S rDNA sequncing, metagenomics, and metatranscriptomics) used to study microbiomes. Each student will give a final presentation on a microbiome research article of their choice.<br><br><strong>Anticipated Terms Offered:</strong> Spring Annually<br><br></div>		</td>
