<div><h3>ENG 284 - Special Topics in 17th- and 18th-Century American Literature </h3>  <p><hr>Special topics in the earliest periods of American letters provide a broad historical foundation for literary study in all fields as well as the opportunity for in-depth investigation of critical issues of colonial and early Republic culture such as gender, race, religious discourse, scientific progress, and political contest. If taken at the undergraduate level, prerequisite: Major American Writers I or permission of the instructor. A student may take this seminar more than once, as long as the topics differ each time. For undergraduate English majors this course may satisfy the Period (D-1 or D-2) requirement but does not double count. May be repeatable for credit.</p>
