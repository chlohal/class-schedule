<div><h3>FILM 1640 - Chinese Film Studies </h3>  <hr>This class aims to familiarize students with not only the overall history of Chinese cinema but also recent significant filmmakers and their works in Mainland China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan. The class will begin with a brief and general survey of Chinese films since the 1920s to the present. As the semester continues our main focus will include films directed by the fifth generation and other important filmmakers in Mainland China as well as award-winning filmmakers in Hong Kong and Taiwan. <br>
