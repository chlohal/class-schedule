<div><h3>HIST 309 - Marriage & the Meanings of America </h3>  <p><hr>Often viewed as a personal decision, marriage is also a public act and institution. Marriage resides at the nexus of private life and community authority. It is simultaneously an emotional and economic arrangement tied to the production of value and the reproduction of the family. More than only a rite, marriage is a right capable of conferring other rights and societal benefits while policing the boundaries of gender, race, and citizenship. This course explores important themes in and approaches to the history of marriage in the United States from the 18th century to the present through an examination of recent scholarship and primary source material. </p>
